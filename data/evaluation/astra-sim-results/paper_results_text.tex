% --- D1: Prediction Fidelity Evidence ---
% For use in \subsection{D1: Self-Reported Accuracy Analysis}

% ASTRA-sim's published accuracy improves with scale: 20.63\% geomean error at
% 2~GPUs, 12.01\% at 4~GPUs, and 9.69\% at 8~GPUs (Ring All-Reduce on
% HGX-H100)~\cite{astrasim2020}. We cannot independently verify these claims
% without datacenter GPU hardware, but our experiments confirm internal
% consistency: all 8 NPUs report identical cycle counts ($\sigma = 0$) across
% all configurations, and collective operation ratios match theoretical
% expectations (Reduce-Scatter = $0.504 \times$ All-Reduce, consistent with
% the $\frac{1}{2}$ theoretical relationship).

% Communication overhead scales monotonically: 0.052\% at 2~GPUs, 0.133\% at
% 4~GPUs, and 0.301\% at 8~GPUs---a 5.76$\times$ increase from 2$\to$8~GPUs.
% This is consistent with ring all-reduce, where each GPU transmits
% $\frac{n-1}{n}$ of the gradient volume and communication time grows linearly
% with participant count while compute remains constant in data-parallel
% training.

% --- D2: Compositional Fidelity Evidence ---
% For use in \subsection{D2: Compositional Fidelity}

% ASTRA-sim composes pre-profiled compute traces with analytically simulated
% communication: $t_{\text{wall}} = t_{\text{compute}} + t_{\text{exposed\_comm}}$.
% At 4~GPUs, the composition adds 1,454,270 communication cycles to
% 1,095,314,000 compute cycles (0.13\% overhead); at 8~GPUs, 3,307,886
% communication cycles (0.30\% overhead). The composition is exact by
% construction (no error propagation), but this sidesteps the harder problem:
% ASTRA-sim requires pre-profiled compute durations from the target hardware,
% making the reported 5--15\% error an underestimate of end-to-end prediction
% difficulty since compute profiling error is excluded.

\textbf{ASTRA-sim: MTAP Assessment.}
We evaluate ASTRA-sim across all five MTAP dimensions using Docker-based deployment on our evaluation platform, running collective microbenchmarks (4 collectives $\times$ 8~NPUs $\times$ 1\,MB) and ResNet-50 data-parallel training at 2, 4, and 8 simulated GPUs on the HGX-H100 configuration.
Of 11 experiments, 7 produce valid results; the 4 failures stem from empty log files (4-NPU microbenchmark) and topology limitations (16/32-GPU configs capped at 8~NPUs).

\emph{D1 (Prediction Fidelity): Medium.}
Published geomean error ranges from 20.63\% (2~GPUs) to 9.69\% (8~GPUs) on HGX-H100 Ring All-Reduce~\cite{astrasim2020}, but we cannot independently verify these without target hardware.
Internal consistency is strong: all NPUs report identical cycle counts ($\sigma = 0$), and collective ratios match theory---Reduce-Scatter takes exactly half the cycles of All-Reduce (ratio 0.504), while All-to-All takes approximately twice (ratio 1.985).
Communication overhead scales 5.76$\times$ from 2$\to$8~GPUs, consistent with ring all-reduce scaling behavior.

\emph{D2 (Compositional Fidelity): Medium.}
ASTRA-sim composes pre-profiled compute traces with simulated communication, yielding wall-time estimates where communication adds 0.13\% overhead at 4~GPUs and 0.30\% at 8~GPUs.
However, it sidesteps kernel-level prediction entirely by requiring hardware-profiled compute durations---a hidden dependency that means its reported accuracy excludes the compute profiling step.
The composition gap $\gamma$ cannot be measured since no kernel-level predictions exist to compare against end-to-end measurements.

\emph{D3 (Generalization): Medium.}
Pre-defined network configurations span HGX-H100 (2--32~GPUs), DGX-V100 (4--8~GPUs), and TPU-v3 (ring, 2D torus), demonstrating hardware generalization via parameterized YAML configs.
However, workload generalization requires generating new Chakra traces for each model architecture; we tested only ResNet-50 data-parallel training.
Docker-based deployment provides strong temporal stability---no version incompatibility issues, unlike pickle-serialized tools.

\emph{D4 (Deployment Viability): High.}
Docker build completes in $<$30 minutes including protobuf compilation from source.
All simulations produce deterministic, bit-identical outputs.
A GitHub Actions CI workflow automates the full pipeline from Docker build through result parsing and artifact upload, confirming production-grade deployment viability.

\emph{D5 (Extensibility): High.}
New hardware requires only a YAML network config (5--20 lines specifying topology, bandwidth, latency).
New workloads use the Chakra trace format, which supports arbitrary computation graphs.
Three pluggable network backends (Analytical, NS-3, HTSim) enable accuracy-speed tradeoffs, and custom collective algorithms can be specified via system configuration.

\emph{Composite score:} $S(\text{ASTRA-sim}) = 0.4 \times 2 + 0.2 \times 2 + 0.2 \times 2 + 0.1 \times 3 + 0.1 \times 3 = 2.2$ (73.3\%).
The tool's primary strengths are deployment viability and extensibility; its primary limitation is that prediction fidelity depends on self-reported accuracy that we cannot independently verify.
