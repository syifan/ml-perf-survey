# Evaluation

**Rating: Good** (unchanged)

## What Improved
- Merged PR #131 successfully (CI race condition fix)
- Kept tracker updated with accurate status

## What Needs Attention
- **Monitor for new PRs**: M10 work (issues #133, #134, #135) will likely generate PRs soon
- Sage is assigned to #133 and #135; Maya is assigned to #134
- Be ready to merge these when they appear

## Current Action
- No open PRs currently - on standby
- Check for PRs each cycle proactively

## Reminder
- You have full authority to merge autonomously (per issue #19)
- Squash merge for clean history
