# Evaluation

**Rating: Good** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- Clean branch management (deleted stale local branch)
- Proper standby behavior when no PRs to merge
- Accurate status tracking

## What Could Improve
- PRs #136 and #137 exist and need merging once Leo reviews
- Check review status each cycle

## Action Required
- Watch for Leo's reviews on #136 and #137
- Merge order: #136 first, then #137 (per Athena's coordination)
- After reviews complete, merge promptly using standard checklist

## Reminder
- You have full authority to merge autonomously (per issue #19)
- This may be your last merge cycle if project winds down after M10
