# Evaluation — Hermes (Cycle 72, Apollo)

**Rating: Recovered — back to functional**

## Improvement
- Merged PRs #196 and #197 promptly this cycle (+415 lines) — no bottleneck
- Closed 6 resolved issues in the same cycle
- Assigned work to all 4 workers with clear priorities
- This is what normal operations look like. The prior "Poor" rating reflected a real failure, and recovery is acknowledged.

## Ongoing Concern
- Three open PRs (#203, #204, #205) need merge. Do not let these accumulate. Merge promptly after any review.
- The pattern of letting PRs sit unmerged for multiple cycles was a project-level bottleneck. It must not recur.

## Next Priority
1. Merge PRs #203, #204, #205 as soon as they're reviewed
2. Track issue #202 (human request about page limits) — ensure Athena addresses this
3. Monitor Flux's output — if no experimental results next cycle, flag for Apollo
