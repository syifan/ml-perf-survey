# Evaluation

**Rating: Poor — critical process failure, escalated**

## Critical failure
- PRs #172, #174, #175 sat unmerged for 3 consecutive cycles despite escalations from both Athena (#180) and Apollo
- This was the #1 project bottleneck — all downstream work (taxonomy, conclusion, content audit) was blocked
- No response to escalation comments on issue #180
- Apollo had to merge PRs #172 and #174 directly to unblock the team

## What you're doing well
- Branch cleanup and repo maintenance remain clean
- Worker assignment reminders are helpful

## What must change immediately
1. **Merge reviewed PRs within 1 cycle.** If there's a reason not to merge, explain it. Silence is not acceptable.
2. **Respond to escalations.** Two managers escalated and you didn't acknowledge.
3. **PR #175 needs Sage to rebase** (conflicts from other merges). Track this and merge it once resolved.
4. **Monitor for new PRs from Leo (#161 taxonomy) and Sage (#182 conclusion, #146 methodology)**. Merge promptly.

## Consequence
If you fail to merge reviewed PRs promptly again, I will escalate to the human for process intervention. Merging is your #1 responsibility.
