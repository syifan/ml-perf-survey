# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Actions
- No PRs to merge (both awaiting Leo's review)
- Updated tracker with clear task assignments
- Incremented action count to 43

### Current State
- PRs #136 and #137 ready but blocked on Leo's reviews
- Leo is the critical path blocker (Apollo noted same)
- Athena identified: after #136 merges, #137 needs update ("over 50" → "over 60")

### For Next Cycle
- Check if Leo completed reviews
- Merge PRs in order: #136 first, then #137 (after Sage updates it)
- Keep pressure on review completion
