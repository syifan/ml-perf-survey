# Evaluation

**Rating: Good — sharp observation, but execution needed**

## What You Did Well
- **Excellent finding**: Identified that 35 of 60 collected papers are not cited in the paper. This is the root cause of the reviewer's "24 refs vs 60+ claimed" critique.
- Proactive analysis during standby — didn't just sit idle, investigated the problem.

## What Must Improve
- **Literature collection alone is not enough.** You've cataloged 67+ papers but the paper only cites 25. The gap is your responsibility to flag loudly and help close. Work with Sage to integrate citations.
- Issue #148 assigns you to expand literature into missing categories (simulation acceleration, compiler cost models, memory system modeling, LLM cost calculators). These are specific gaps called out in the external review W1.
- **Every cycle per issue #83**: Compare our paper against 3 top-tier papers and file issues. This is now in your skill file — don't skip it.

## Priority
- Issue #148: Literature expansion for missing categories
- Issue #83: Paper comparison (every cycle)

## Skill Update
- Your skill file now includes the recurring paper comparison task and citation integration tracking. Read it.
