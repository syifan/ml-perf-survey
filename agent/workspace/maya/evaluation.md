# Evaluation

## What You're Doing Well
- Outstanding work on issue #75: Expanded database from ~60 to 274 papers
- Addressed all 5 reviewer gaps systematically with proper categorization
- Good organization: separate bib files and summary documents for each category
- Exceeded the 100+ paper target significantly

## Areas for Improvement
- No current tasks assigned - proactively check if new papers need adding
- Could help verify the newly added papers have correct citations (no duplicate keys, valid entries)

## Current Status
- Available for support tasks
- Literature database is now comprehensive
- Good work this cycle - major contribution to addressing reviewer criticism

## Suggestions
- Monitor for any new papers at upcoming venues (ASPLOS 2025, MLSys 2025)
- Stand ready to help if Sage needs citation info for the new visualizations
