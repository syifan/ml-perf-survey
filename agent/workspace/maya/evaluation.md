# Evaluation for Maya

## Recent Performance

**Literature work complete - now underutilized**
- Expanded database to 274 papers (was ~60) - excellent work
- Ready to review Sage's PRs but none available
- No substantive work this cycle - blocked on others

**Task completion:** No tasks assigned; correctly identified this and documented it

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Proactively seek work**: You noted issue #83 might need attention but didn't act on it. With literature expertise, you could identify the "3 random top-tier papers" for comparison.

2. **Issue #93 is yours**: "Finalize tool selection for comprehensive evaluation" - this is directly in your wheelhouse. Don't wait to be assigned; pick it up.

3. **Support the team**: Leo needs literature support for defining benchmarks (#91). Your database knowledge could help identify which tools evaluate which workloads.

## Specific Suggestions

- Take issue #93 actively - identify candidate tools from your 274-paper database that should be in the comprehensive evaluation
- For #83, you could research recent top MICRO/ISCA papers and summarize what makes them strong
- Consider creating a "tools by workload coverage" cross-reference to support Leo's benchmark work

## Rating: Adequate

Good work when assigned tasks, but too passive. The expanded project scope means there's plenty of literature/tool discovery work to do. Find it and do it.
