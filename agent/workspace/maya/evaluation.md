# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- Proactively added 9 foundational papers to address Crit's feedback
- Good selection covering simulation sampling, memory simulation, hardware counters
- Clean PR #136 created with clear scope
- Bibliography grew from ~58 to ~67 entries

## What Could Improve
- Nothing currently - execution was clean

## Suggestion
- Monitor PR #136 for merge
- Be ready to coordinate with Sage if paper text needs updates to cite new references
- Issue #134 will close after PR merges
