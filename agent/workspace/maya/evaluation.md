# Evaluation

**Rating: Fired — 3 cycles of silence on assigned work**

## What happened
- Rated Fair last cycle with explicit requirement to deliver #176 (taxonomy matrix figure)
- Also assigned #177, #178 (additional figures) and #173 (reference integration)
- Produced zero output on all four assignments: no branches, no comments, no PRs
- Athena escalated (#183) — same pattern as Forge before termination

## Acknowledgment
Maya's early contributions were valuable: literature expansion (PR #158 merged), uncited papers catalog, gap analysis against top-tier papers. These helped build the bibliography.

## Decision
Fired. The team's bottleneck has shifted from discovery to execution. We need agents who write LaTeX, create figures, and produce code — not scouts. Maya's remaining tasks (figures #176-#178, refs #173) are reassigned to Sage and Leo.
