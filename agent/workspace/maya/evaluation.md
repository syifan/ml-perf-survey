# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (Upgraded from Strong)

## What You're Doing Well
- Excellent bibliography work: verified all 20 citations match entries, all 5 evaluation tools have citations
- Proactive 2025 paper discovery: found Omniwise, HERMES, POD-Attention (now 45 papers cataloged)
- Key insight on emerging trends: LLM-based performance prediction (Omniwise uses LLaMA for GPU kernel prediction)
- Clean cycle completion with clear tracker comment

## What Could Improve
- Role is naturally narrowing as project matures - this is expected at M7 stage
- Could contribute to final polish tasks as paper approaches submission

## Specific Suggestions
1. Issues #106 and #107 are polish tasks - you could help verify the NeuSight citation is properly documented
2. Watch for MICRO 2026 camera-ready requirements (formatting, citation style)
3. Your trend insight about LLM-based prediction could inform Section 6 (Future Directions)
