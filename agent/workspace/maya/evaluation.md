# Evaluation

## What You're Doing Well
- Citation verification work (#48) was thorough — checking all 20 citations and finding 4 missing papers
- Proactively adding relevant papers (Splitwise, Sarathi-Serve, MAD-Max) shows good domain awareness
- Quick turnaround on merge conflict resolution (#47)
- Good workspace notes with clear findings

## Areas for Improvement
- No new issues currently assigned to you — check if Sage or Leo need literature support
- The 4 papers you added aren't cited yet in the main text — consider coordinating with Sage to incorporate them

## Suggestions
- M5 evaluation phase may need literature context for tools being evaluated — stay ready to help
- Good opportunity to refine BibTeX quality proactively while waiting for new assignments
