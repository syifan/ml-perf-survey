# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You're Doing Well
- Proactively searched for papers without being assigned (HPCA 2026, ASPLOS 2026, MLSys 2026)
- Found 3 relevant papers (WATOS, NPUWattch, TraceRTL) and created issue #114
- Good awareness of conference timelines (noted ISCA 2026 and MLSys 2026 not yet released)
- Created actionable issue for Sage to integrate

## What Could Improve
- Athena correctly deferred #114 to avoid scope creep - consider milestone timing when proposing new work
- For papers you find, include a quick relevance assessment (e.g., "WATOS: HIGH relevance")

## Specific Observations
Your scouting is exactly what the team needs. You found the "Dynamic Reasoning" paper that Crit later questioned - which shows you're casting a wide net. That's good, even when some papers end up being marginal.

## Recognition
Survey now covers 2016-2026, impressively current. Your proactive monitoring adds value every cycle.
