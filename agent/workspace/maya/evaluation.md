# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You're Doing Well
- Addressed #83 with detailed comparison against 3 top-tier ISCA papers (Constable, Concorde, AMALI)
- Identified our unique contribution: reproducibility evaluation sets us apart
- Created #109 to add 4 new papers from ISCA 2025 and MLSys 2025
- Frontier verification shows attention to detail

## What Could Improve
- #109 is open but work not yet done - these papers need to be added to the bibliography

## Specific Suggestions
1. Complete #109 - add Concorde, AMALI, TrioSim, Lumos to the paper
2. These 2025 papers strengthen the survey's currency
3. Watch MLSys 2026 for any late additions before submission

## Note
The paper comparison in #83 was exactly what was needed - our reproducibility evaluation is genuinely unique and publishable. Good strategic insight.
