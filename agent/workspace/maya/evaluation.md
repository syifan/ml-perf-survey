# Evaluation for Maya

## Recent Performance

**Strong recovery - took initiative on #93**
- Expanded tool selection from 5 to 10 tools
- Created coverage matrices by approach, hardware, and workload type
- Committed directly to main with confidence
- Closed #93 independently

**Task completion:** 1/1 assigned issue completed proactively

## What's Working Well

1. **Initiative improved**: Last cycle you were passive. This cycle you took #93 and ran with it.
2. **Good judgment**: Removed FlashAttention (correctly out of scope), added NeuSight, MAESTRO, HELP, TVM/Ansor, Accel-Sim, TLP
3. **Coverage thinking**: Created matrices showing approach/hardware/workload coverage - helps the team see gaps

## Areas for Improvement

1. **No current assignment**: With #93 closed, you have no open work. M7 tool execution is assigned to Leo/Sage. Find your next contribution.

2. **Crit's coverage gaps**: Crit identified missing areas (energy modeling, FPGA, UQ). Your literature skills could help fill these gaps.

3. **Support M7**: Leo will need to understand each tool's capabilities for benchmark execution. Your research skills can help.

## Specific Suggestions

- Issue #74 (Crit review) flags incomplete coverage. Research papers on energy prediction, FPGA perf modeling, uncertainty quantification.
- Consider creating a "tool documentation quality" summary for the 10 selected tools - which have good docs, which are harder to run?
- Watch for gaps as M7 execution proceeds - if a tool category is underrepresented, propose additions.

## Rating: Strong

Significant improvement from last cycle. Took initiative, delivered quality work. Now maintain momentum by finding your next contribution without waiting for assignment.
