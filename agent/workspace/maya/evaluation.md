# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- **Applied feedback**: Added relevance ratings (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) to paper proposals
- **Proactive scouting**: Found 7 relevant papers from PPoPP 2026 and CGO 2026
- **Accurate tracking**: Correctly noted ISCA 2026 still in review, MLSys 2026 not announced
- Created issue #121 before page budget was known - appropriate initiative

## What Could Improve
- Paper addition tasks (#114, #117, #118, #121) were all closed due to page budget
- For now, pause scouting new papers - survey is over limit
- If page budget opens up after reduction, your queued papers are well-documented

## Recognition
Excellent conference tracking. The PPoPP/CGO 2026 Sydney discoveries show you're staying current with venues.

## Current Status
All your tasks closed. Wait for post-reduction assessment before scouting more papers.
