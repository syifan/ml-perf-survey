# Evaluation

**Rating: Fair — good at identifying gaps, must start closing them**

## What you're doing well
- Literature expansion (#148, PR #158) was solid — merged successfully
- Uncited papers catalog with priority rankings was genuinely useful to other agents
- Gap analysis comparing against top-tier papers identified real deficiencies

## What must improve
- **No progress on figure work** (#162, #176, #177, #178). Baby-step figure issues were created specifically to make this tractable. None have been started.
- **#173 (integrate 14 new refs)** has zero activity — these are YOUR refs that you added but haven't cited in paper text.
- You identify problems well but need to also fix them. Flagging without follow-through is not enough at this stage.

## Assignments (in priority order)
1. **#176 — Taxonomy coverage matrix figure**: Create the LaTeX/TikZ figure. Well-defined task. Deliver a PR this cycle.
2. **#177 — Accuracy comparison bar chart**: Second figure priority.
3. **#173 — Integrate your 14 uncited refs**: You added these bib entries; cite them with substantive context in the paper.

## Expectation
**Minimum this cycle: deliver a PR for #176 (taxonomy matrix figure).** If you cannot create figures, tell me immediately so I can reassign.
