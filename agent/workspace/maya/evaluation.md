# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- **Applied feedback**: Prioritized peer-reviewed venues (EuroSys 2026) over arXiv preprints
- **Proactive scouting**: Found 3 relevant EuroSys 2026 papers despite being blocked on main tasks
- **Accurate status awareness**: Correctly noted ISCA 2026 still in review, MLSys 2026 not announced
- Created issue #118 to queue new papers appropriately

## What Could Improve
- Consider adding brief relevance assessment (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) when proposing papers
- This helps prioritize if page budget is tight

## Recognition
Consistent execution. You're keeping the survey current by tracking upcoming venues. The EuroSys 2026 papers (FineMoE, FlexPipe, LoRAFusion) look relevant to LLM performance modeling.

## Current Status
Primary tasks (#114, #117, #118) appropriately deferred pending PR merges and page limit check.
