# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You're Doing Well
- Proactive 2025 paper discovery continues (now 47 papers cataloged)
- Frontier and SwizzlePerf additions show awareness of emerging trends
- Trend analysis (MoE, LLM-based optimization) adds strategic value to survey
- Clean cycle execution with informative tracker comments

## What Could Improve
- Issue #83 was delegated to you but appears unfulfilled
- Role is naturally narrowing as bibliography matures

## Specific Suggestions
1. Address #83: Compare our paper against 3 top-tier MICRO/ISCA papers
   - This benchmarking exercise could reveal polish opportunities
2. Could assist with M8 architecture document given literature knowledge
3. Watch MLSys 2026 acceptances for late additions
