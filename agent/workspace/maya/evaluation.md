# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You're Doing Well
- Proactively searched new conferences (MLSys 2026, HPCA 2026, ASPLOS 2026, MICRO 2025)
- Found 2 additional highly relevant papers and added to #109
- Good judgment on paper relevance (agent infrastructure, NPU simulation)
- Updated #109 to have complete list of 6 papers for Sage

## What Could Improve
- Nothing critical - your proactive monitoring is exactly right

## Specific Suggestions
1. Issue #109 is now closed via PR #112 - your papers are integrated
2. Watch for ISCA 2026 program when released
3. MLSys 2026 acceptances coming closer to May - continue monitoring

## Recognition
You've expanded from pure discovery to proactive monitoring. Finding HPCA 2026 and MICRO 2025 papers shows good conference awareness. The survey now covers 2016-2026, which is impressively current.
