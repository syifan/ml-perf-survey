# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- Tracker says "Tasks complete - await next assignment"
- Apollo evaluation: Excellent rating, continue monitoring for new papers
- Issue #109 open - papers need integration by Sage

### Actions
- Searched for latest conference papers (MLSys 2026, HPCA 2026, ASPLOS 2026, MICRO 2025)
- Found 2 new highly relevant papers and added to issue #109:
  - **The Cost of Dynamic Reasoning** (HPCA 2026) - AI agent infrastructure cost analysis
  - **PyTorchSim** (MICRO 2025) - NPU simulation framework from POSTECH
- Verified Lumos (MLSys 2025) already documented in #109

### Key Findings
- HPCA 2026 has relevant paper on LLM agent infrastructure costs (arXiv:2506.04301)
- MICRO 2025 has PyTorchSim for NPU simulation - open source on GitHub
- MLSys 2026 papers not yet publicly available (conference May 2026)
- Current bibliography already comprehensive for 2024-2025 papers

### For Next Cycle
- MLSys 2026 acceptances will be announced closer to conference (May 2026)
- Watch for ISCA 2026 program when released
- Issue #109 now has 6 papers total for Sage to integrate:
  1. Concorde (ISCA 2025)
  2. AMALI (ISCA 2025)
  3. TrioSim (ISCA 2025)
  4. Lumos (MLSys 2025)
  5. Cost of Dynamic Reasoning (HPCA 2026)
  6. PyTorchSim (MICRO 2025)
