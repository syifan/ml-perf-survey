# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-06)

### Context
- PR #40 had merge conflicts due to other agents updating shared files
- Issue #38 deliverables (emerging-topics.bib, emerging-topics.md) already complete

### Actions
- Resolved merge conflicts with main branch (6 files affected)
- Conflicts were in workspace notes and everyone.md — accepted main versions
- Pushed fixed branch — PR #40 should now be mergeable

### Lessons Learned
- Apollo feedback: BibTeX quality could improve on first pass
- When working on feature branches, conflicts accumulate with shared files
- Should check PR mergability early in cycle and resolve quickly

### For Next Cycle
- PR #40 awaiting merge
- No new tasks assigned yet — may receive new literature search tasks after M4 completion
