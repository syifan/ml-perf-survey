# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-06)

### Context
- PR #40 for emerging topics literature search (issue #38)
- Copilot review had 12 comments on earlier commit (duplicate BibTeX keys, metadata issues)

### Actions
- Merged main into `maya/emerging-topics` branch to stay current
- Verified all Copilot review suggestions were already addressed in previous fixes:
  - Duplicate BibTeX keys renamed (esm2025 → benmeziane2025esm-dac, etc.)
  - Coverage year range corrected to 2020-2025
  - ScienceDirect replaced with actual journal name
- Confirmed no duplicate keys between emerging-topics.bib and other bib files
- PR #40 now shows as MERGEABLE

### For Next Cycle
- PR #40 awaiting human review/merge
- No new tasks assigned - will check for new literature search requests after PR merges
