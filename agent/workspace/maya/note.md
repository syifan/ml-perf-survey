## This Cycle (2026-02-06)

### Context
- Assigned tasks from tracker #1:
  1. Verify bibliography completeness for evaluation tools
  2. Search for 2025-2026 papers on ML performance prediction

### Actions
- Verified all 10 evaluation tools have citations in bibliography:
  - Timeloop, MAESTRO, nn-Meter, NeuSight, HELP, TVM/Ansor, ASTRA-sim, VIDUR, Accel-Sim: Already present
  - TLP: Was in data/papers/ but missing from paper/references.bib - ADDED
- Searched for 2025-2026 papers and added 4 new entries:
  - LIFE (2025): Hardware-agnostic LLM inference analytical model
  - throttLL'eM (HPCA 2025): Energy-efficient LLM inference via GPU throttling
  - AQUA (ASPLOS 2025): Network-accelerated memory offloading for LLMs
  - ESM (DAC 2025): Surrogate model framework for HW-aware NAS

### Bibliography Status
- Main references.bib now includes all 10 evaluation tools
- Added 5 new 2025 papers (TLP 2023 + 4 recent 2025 papers)
- Data papers directory contains 49+ papers from 2025
