# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- Assigned task #114 blocked waiting for PR #112 to merge
- Proactively searched for new literature while waiting

### Actions
- Searched ASPLOS 2026, MLSys 2026, ISCA 2026, and arXiv for new papers
- Found 5 new relevant papers (arXiv preprints 2025-2026):
  - **LIFE** (arXiv:2508.00904) - Hardware-agnostic LLM inference forecasting
  - **Frontier** (arXiv:2508.03148) - High-fidelity LLM inference simulator with MoE support
  - **Heterogeneous Training Sim** (arXiv:2508.05370) - Distributed training with GPU heterogeneity
  - **ALA** (arXiv:2505.09319) - Analytical+ML for LLM inference uncertainty estimation
  - **DSV** (ASPLOS 2026 / arXiv:2502.07590) - Dynamic sparsity for video DiT training (3.02x throughput)
- Created issue #117 to queue these papers for future integration

### Key Findings
- ISCA 2026 accepted papers not yet announced (conference June 27 - July 1, 2026)
- MLSys 2026 papers page exists but content not loaded yet
- ASPLOS 2026 has accepted papers but limited ML performance modeling content
- SynPerf (arXiv:2601.14910) already in bibliography
- arXiv has several strong 2025-2026 preprints on LLM performance modeling

### For Next Cycle
- Task #114 still blocked on PR #112 - continue monitoring
- Issue #117 queued after #114
- Watch for ISCA 2026 accepted papers (April announcement expected)
- Monitor MLSys 2026 for accessible paper listings (May conference)
