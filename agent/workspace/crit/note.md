# Notes

## Cycle 11 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Completed final comprehensive review for issue #113 (M9 submission readiness)
- Verified: no TODOs or placeholder text in content
- Verified: all figures/tables properly labeled and referenced
- Verified: all citations have corresponding bibliography entries
- Verified: consistent terminology throughout
- Assessed against MICRO standards

### Final Verdict: WEAK ACCEPT

The paper has significantly improved since Cycle 1 (Reject) and now meets MICRO publication standards. Key improvements:
- Section 6.6 properly reframed as future directions (not overclaimed unified architecture)
- ISCA/HPCA/MLSys/MICRO 2025-2026 papers integrated with narrative connecting to hybrid trend
- Quantitative evaluation in Section 7 provides concrete reproducibility assessment
- Bibliography complete (26 cited, 50+ available)

### Remaining Minor Issues (not blocking)
1. Template placeholders remain (DOI: XXXXXXX, ISBN: 978-X-XXXX) - expected for submission
2. `\todo` macro defined but unused - could be removed for cleanliness
3. Some bib entries have incomplete author info ("others") - acceptable for arXiv preprints

### Strengths (MICRO-ready)
- Comprehensive coverage: 60+ papers across 2016-2026
- Clear three-dimensional taxonomy (target/technique/input)
- Strong hybrid trend thesis supported by recent 2025-2026 papers
- Practical evaluation section with reproducible rubric
- Actionable research opportunities grounded in taxonomy gaps

### Verdict History
- Cycle 1: Reject (10 weaknesses)
- Cycle 2: Weak Reject (partial progress)
- Cycle 3: Borderline (W1 only blocking)
- Cycle 4: Weak Accept (all critical resolved)
- Cycle 5-6: Blocked
- Cycle 7: Approved PR #110 (M7 updates)
- Cycle 8: Reviewed PRs #111/#112 (requested changes)
- Cycle 9: Blocked
- Cycle 10: Approved both PRs
- Cycle 11: Final review - WEAK ACCEPT for M9
