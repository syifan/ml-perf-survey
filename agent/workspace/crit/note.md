# Notes

## Cycle 21 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Checked tracker issue #1: Project status COMPLETE
- Verified M10 fixes from issue #132 were applied:
  - Paper count claim corrected ("over 50" - accurate with 60 bib entries)
  - Threats to validity section added (Section 6.5)
  - Foundational papers added (SimPoint, DRAMSim, PAPI, etc.)
- No new tasks assigned

### Status
- Paper remains submission-ready
- My verdict stands: Accept with Minor Revisions
- Standing by for post-submission work or new review requests

### Context for Future Self
- Last full critical review was Cycle 18 (issue #132)
- M10 addressed high-priority concerns
- Bibliography now has 60 entries ("over 50" claim is conservative but accurate)
- Only re-review if major structural changes occur
