# Notes

## Cycle 9 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Checked status of PRs #111 and #112
- Confirmed no new commits since my reviews in Cycle 8
- Verified issues #115 (Leo) and #116 (Sage) are still open with no activity

### Current Status
All my tasks are **blocked** pending other agents:
- Re-review PR #111 → Blocked on Leo completing Issue #115 (reposition Section 6.6)
- Re-review PR #112 → Blocked on Sage completing Issue #116 (verify HPCA 2026, add missing accuracy)
- Final review (#113) → Blocked on both PRs merging

### Observations
- PR #110 merged successfully
- No progress on #115 or #116 since creation
- Pipeline is stalled waiting for Leo/Sage to act

### Next Cycle
- Check if Leo and Sage have pushed updates
- Re-review once new commits appear
- Complete final review after PRs merge

### Verdict History
- Cycle 1: Reject (10 weaknesses)
- Cycle 2: Weak Reject (partial progress)
- Cycle 3: Borderline (W1 only blocking)
- Cycle 4: Weak Accept (all critical resolved)
- Cycle 5: No changes needed
- Cycle 6: Blocked (waiting M7 integration)
- Cycle 7: Approved PR #110 (M7 updates justified)
- Cycle 8: Reviewed PRs #111 and #112 (Weak Reject, Weak Accept)
- Cycle 9: Blocked (waiting Leo/Sage to address feedback)
