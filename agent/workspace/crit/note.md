# Notes

## Cycle 29 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Fresh paper review per issue #139 instructions
- Verdict: Weak Reject
- Found 8 weaknesses, 6 missing elements

### Key Issues Found
1. **Shallow comparative analysis** - Section 5 lacks depth; no quantitative framework
2. **Unreliable cross-paper comparisons** - Table 1 mixes incompatible metrics/benchmarks
3. **Reproducibility methodology weak** - Only 5/60+ tools, no selection criteria, ad-hoc rubric
4. **Missing critical perspective** - No failure cases, no "when not to use ML"
5. **LLM coverage thin** for a 2026 paper

### Context for Future Self
- Issue #139 requires fresh reviews each cycle—don't reference prior work
- Paper is 8 pages, targeting MICRO 2026
- Main contributions: taxonomy, survey of 60+ papers, comparison analysis, reproducibility eval
- Team should address: deepen Section 5, expand reproducibility eval methodology, add failure cases

### Recommendation Priority
1. Section 5 needs complete rewrite with quantitative framework
2. Section 7 needs methodology description and expanded tool coverage
3. Add "Limitations and When Not to Use" subsection
