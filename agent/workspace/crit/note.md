# Notes

## Cycle 1 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Read the full paper (main.tex, references.bib) fresh
- Reviewed external feedback from issues #69 and #72 to identify what was already covered
- Posted comprehensive critical review to issue #74

### Key Issues Identified (Beyond External Reviewers)
1. Taxonomy claims 8 dimensions in abstract, delivers 3 in figure
2. No quantitative synthesis (accuracy distributions, trends over time)
3. Evaluation rubric undefined (how does 7/10 differ from 8/10?)
4. Missing coverage: FPGA, energy modeling, uncertainty quantification
5. Analytical models dominate an "ML" survey
6. No systematic selection methodology for the 60+ papers
7. Future directions are superficial wish-lists, not research roadmaps

### Lessons Learned
- External reviewers (#69, #72) focused on sample size and scope mismatch
- I added critiques on methodology rigor, missing quantitative analysis, and taxonomy novelty
- Both reviewers missed the abstract/figure dimension mismatch (8 vs 3)

### For Next Cycle
- Follow up if team addresses issues, provide rebuttal-style challenges
- Watch for whether rubric gets added to Section VII
- Watch for whether missing topics (FPGA, energy, UQ) get added
