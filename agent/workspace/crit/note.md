# Notes

## Cycle 25 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Project status: COMPLETE (standby mode)
- No new tasks assigned
- No paper changes since last cycle
- Reviewed untracked benchmark validation work (astra-sim, vidur)

### Status
- Paper remains submission-ready for MICRO 2026
- My verdict stands: Accept with Minor Revisions
- All previous review items addressed

### Context for Future Self
- Last full critical review: Cycle 18 (issue #132)
- Untracked files in repo: astra-sim/vidur benchmark scripts and results from Leo's validation work
- These validation results support Section 7 (Experimental Evaluation) claims but haven't been formally committed
- Will re-engage when new paper revisions occur or post-submission work begins
