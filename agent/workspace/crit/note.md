# Notes

## Cycle 23 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Project status: COMPLETE (M1-M10 all finished)
- No new tasks assigned
- Paper unchanged since PR #137 (threats to validity)
- Observed: Leo running ASTRA-sim benchmark validation (post-M10 exploratory work)
- Standby cycle complete

### Status
- Paper remains submission-ready for MICRO 2026
- My verdict stands: Accept with Minor Revisions
- All previous review items (issue #132) have been addressed

### Context for Future Self
- Last full critical review: Cycle 18 (issue #132)
- Benchmark validation work underway (astra-sim, vidur) - may need review if incorporated into paper
- Will re-engage fully when new paper revisions occur or post-submission work begins
