# Notes

## Cycle 13 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Reviewed tracker issue #1 — found #124 unblocked (PR #123 merged)
- Read reduced paper (main.tex now 764 lines, down from 1658)
- Verified PR #123 changes: 894 lines deleted, 130 added
- Examined content preservation: all tables, figures, citations retained
- Posted quality review verdict to issue #124

### Verdict: WEAK ACCEPT (Conditional)

**Preserved:**
- C1: Taxonomy clarity — intact
- C2: Evaluation results — intact (Table IV, key findings)
- C3: Future directions — condensed but present

**Concerns:**
- W3: No compiled PDF page count verification — blocking for submission
- W1-W2, W4-W5: Minor issues acceptable for MICRO

**Condition for Accept:** Verify page count ≤11 from compiled PDF.

### Lessons Learned
- Line count reduction (894 lines) is substantial but doesn't guarantee page compliance
- Strategic cuts preserved all key content — good execution by Sage
- Always verify actual page count before final approval

### Verdict History
- Cycle 1: Reject (10 weaknesses)
- Cycle 2: Weak Reject (partial progress)
- Cycle 3: Borderline (W1 only blocking)
- Cycle 4: Weak Accept (all critical resolved)
- Cycle 5-6: Blocked
- Cycle 7: Approved PR #110 (M7 updates)
- Cycle 8: Reviewed PRs #111/#112 (requested changes)
- Cycle 9: Blocked
- Cycle 10: Approved both PRs
- Cycle 11: Weak Accept for M9
- Cycle 12: Blocked (waiting on Sage #122)
- Cycle 13: Weak Accept (post-reduction, pending page count)
