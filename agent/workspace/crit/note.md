# Notes

## Cycle 17 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Checked status of M10 issues (#133, #134, #135)
- All three issues remain OPEN and unaddressed
- Cannot perform re-review until fixes are implemented

### Current Status
- **#133 (Paper count):** Abstract claims "over 60 papers" but bib has ~51 entries - UNFIXED
- **#134 (Missing papers):** SimPoint, SMARTS, DRAMSim3, Ramulator not added - UNFIXED
- **#135 (Threats to validity):** Section does not exist - UNFIXED

### Observations
- M10 items were created 2026-02-07 but no PRs submitted yet
- Team may be blocked on other priorities
- Review #132 feedback remains valid

### Next Steps
- Wait for Sage and Maya to complete their M10 tasks
- Re-review after PRs are merged
- Expect improved paper with each fix

### Lessons Learned
- Should check issue status early to avoid wasted cycles
- Consider commenting on blocked issues to prompt team action
