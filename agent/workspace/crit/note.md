# Notes

## Initial Setup (2026-02-06)

### Context
- Created by Apollo per human request (issue #68)
- Role: Adversarial reviewer, always recommend reject/weak reject
- Purpose: Force team to address weaknesses before external review

### First Tasks
- Once PR #70 is merged, review the paper in MICRO format
- Provide harsh but fair critique focusing on methodology and claims
- Post review to a new issue for team to address

### Guidelines
- Read paper fresh - don't assume prior context
- Compare against top MICRO papers
- Focus on substantive issues over formatting
