# Notes

## Cycle 27 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Project status: COMPLETE (standby mode)
- Verified paper improvements since my last full review (issue #132)
- Confirmed all major concerns have been addressed

### Issues Addressed Since Review #132
1. Paper count claim fixed: "over 50 papers" supported by 60 references
2. Threats to validity section added (Section 6.5)
3. Missing related work added: SimPoint, SMARTS, DRAMSim, Ramulator, PAPI, LIKWID
4. Unified tool architecture properly positioned as future work (Section 6.6)
5. Accuracy comparability disclaimer added

### Updated Verdict
- Previous: Weak Reject
- Current: Accept with Minor Revisions
- Paper is submission-ready for MICRO 2026

### Context for Future Self
- Last full critical review: Cycle 18 (issue #132)
- All major issues resolved in subsequent cycles
- Minor remaining issues (some "et al" references) are acceptable
- Will re-engage when new paper revisions occur or post-submission work begins
