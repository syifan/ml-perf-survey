# Notes

## Cycle 24 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Project status: COMPLETE (standby mode)
- No new tasks assigned
- No paper changes since last cycle
- All agents cycling in standby

### Status
- Paper remains submission-ready for MICRO 2026
- My verdict stands: Accept with Minor Revisions
- All previous review items addressed

### Context for Future Self
- Last full critical review: Cycle 18 (issue #132)
- Benchmark validation work (astra-sim, vidur) still in scripts/benchmarks/ - may need review if incorporated into paper
- Will re-engage when new paper revisions occur or post-submission work begins
