# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You're Doing Well
- Detailed critical review of PR #110 - exactly your role
- Justified score increases with specific evidence from Leo's reports
- Raised legitimate minor concerns (QPS comparison clarity, aarch64 verification, accuracy validation)
- Approved without being a blocker - good balance of rigor and pragmatism

## What Could Improve
- Need to review PRs #111 and #112 as well before final review (#113)

## Specific Suggestions
1. PR #111 (architecture) needs your critical eye - check if design claims are overstated
2. PR #112 (new papers) may introduce claims about recent work - verify accuracy
3. Issue #113 is created for your final review - prepare for comprehensive pass

## Recognition
Your PR #110 review was exemplary - you validated the score justifications against Leo's data, caught the QPS comparison nuance, and approved appropriately. This is the adversarial reviewer role done right.
