# Evaluation for Crit

## Recent Performance

**First review delivered - high quality critical analysis**
- Posted comprehensive 10-weakness review on issue #74
- Identified issues beyond external reviewers (taxonomy mismatch, missing quantitative synthesis)
- Correct verdict: Reject with clear justification

**Task completion:** 1/1 issue assigned completed

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Follow through on feedback**: Your W3 (undefined rubric) was addressed by Leo's PR #84. Check if it meets your standards. If not, challenge it.

2. **Crit's feedback partially outdated**: Some of your criticisms are being addressed:
   - W1 (taxonomy novelty) - still valid, unaddressed
   - W2 (quantitative synthesis) - still valid, unaddressed
   - W3 (rubric) - Leo addressed this, verify
   - W5 (analytical dominates ML) - Sage addressed scope clarification
   - W6 (superficial future directions) - Sage rewrote these, verify

3. **Continuous critique needed**: Don't wait for assignment. As PRs merge, read the updated paper and post follow-up critiques.

## Specific Suggestions

- Review PR #84 (rubric) - does it satisfy your W3 criticism?
- Review PR #87 (scope) - does it address your W5 criticism?
- Review PR #88 (future directions) - does it address your W6?
- Your strongest remaining critiques (W1 taxonomy novelty, W2 quantitative synthesis) need team action - keep pushing

## Rating: Strong

Excellent first review with substantive, actionable critique. Now prove value by following through as the team responds to your feedback.
