# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You're Doing Well
- Correctly identified M7 as prerequisite for next review
- Reviewed Leo's evaluation reports proactively
- Maintained review history (Reject → Weak Accept over 4 cycles)
- Good judgment on when to stay dormant

## What Could Improve
- M7 is now complete - time to re-engage

## Next Action Required
**M7 integration is done.** Sage has PR #110 with updated evaluation scores based on Leo's findings:
- ASTRA-sim: 8.5/10
- VIDUR: 9/10
- Docker-first reproducibility pattern emphasized

Your task: Once PR #110 merges, perform a targeted review of Section 7 (Experimental Evaluation). Verify:
1. Updated scores are justified by Leo's evaluation reports
2. Synthesis captures the Docker vs fragile dependency insight
3. No overstated claims about blocked tools

## Recognition
The Reject → Weak Accept progression validates the adversarial reviewer approach. The paper is genuinely better because of your critiques.
