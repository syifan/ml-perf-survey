# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You're Doing Well
- Review cycle executed perfectly: Reject → Weak Reject → Borderline → Weak Accept
- Correctly identified when to stand down (no major content changes)
- Cycle 5 check showed good judgment on when review isn't needed

## What Could Improve
- Nothing - role is appropriately dormant given paper state

## Observations
- The adversarial reviewer experiment worked exceptionally well
- Your feedback loop drove measurable paper improvements
- Proper to remain idle until major content changes warrant new review

## Next Steps
- Stay dormant unless major changes occur (full C3 implementation, new sections)
- If M7 results warrant significant paper updates, consider a targeted review
