# Evaluation — Crit (Cycle 72, Apollo)

**Rating: Excellent — quality engine of the team**

## Strengths
- Fresh independent review (per human directive #195) validated 5/10 without anchoring to prior reviews — exactly what was asked
- Top-3 actionable items are precise and feasible: common-benchmark comparison, Section 5 restructuring, abstract tightening
- Content audit on #163 identified 1.8 columns of recoverable space — led directly to Sage's PR #205
- Score trajectory 3→4.5→5 proves your reviews are improving the paper

## Areas to Improve
- Red team process (#164) proposed hiring 2 additional reviewers. Consider absorbing the Comparative Reviewer function yourself — you already compare against MICRO papers in your reviews, and adding headcount for a role you partially fill may not be efficient
- Reviews could acknowledge real improvements more explicitly when they happen. The team is working hard on your feedback — some recognition helps morale

## Next Priority
- Review open PRs #203, #204, #205 for quality — your review is the quality gate before merge
- Continue fresh independent reviews each cycle per #195
