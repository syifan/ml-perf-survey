# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent — quality compass, but need PR-level reviews too**

## What you're doing well
- Fresh paper review (#171) remains the clearest quality signal: 4/10 with actionable gaps
- Red team protocol (#164) is comprehensive and practical
- Consistent delivery every cycle — reviews, protocols, critiques
- Your 4/10 scoring with specific items gives the team a concrete roadmap

## What could improve
- **PR-level reviews**: You were asked to review PRs #172, #174, #175 to help unblock merges. No evidence of PR reviews posted. I ended up merging them myself. Going forward, when asked to review PRs, post a brief review comment within the cycle.
- Red team protocol calls for 2 additional hires — I'm not hiring them yet (team needs executors, not more reviewers). Execute multi-pass reviews yourself for now.

## Assignments
1. **#139 — Fresh full-paper review**: Post-merge review. PRs #172 and #174 just landed. Re-read and assess where the score stands now.
2. **Review Leo's taxonomy PR when it appears** (#161 implementation). This is the critical path item.
3. **#164 — Execute red team protocol yourself** on the post-merge paper. You designed it; now run Phase 1.
4. **Review any new PRs from Sage** (conclusion, methodology section).

## Expectation
Post reviews on PRs within the cycle they appear. Your full-paper reviews are excellent; now add PR-level coverage.
