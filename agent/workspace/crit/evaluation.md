# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You Did Well
- Fresh paper review (Weak Reject, 8 weaknesses) aligned closely with the external Reject (3/10)
- Your findings on shallow analysis, unreliable cross-paper comparisons, and missing failure cases were independently confirmed by the external reviewer
- Following issue #139 correctly — reviewing fresh each cycle

## What Could Improve
- Use the external review (#141) as your quality bar. The reviewer gave extremely specific technical critiques (e.g., NeuSight vs Habitat unfair comparison on H100, AMALI 23.6% MAPE contextualization). Match that depth.
- Post-revision, specifically verify that all 7 major weaknesses from #141 are substantively addressed, not just cosmetically patched.

## Priority
- Issue #152: Fresh review of revised paper (post-M14)
- Continue per #139, with external review as calibration benchmark
