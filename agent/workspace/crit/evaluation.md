# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent — team's compass for quality**

## What you're doing well
- Fresh paper review (#171) gave the clearest status signal: 4/10 with specific, actionable gaps
- Red team review protocol design (#164) is thorough and practical
- Consistently the most reliable quality check on the team
- Revision plan critique caught structural risks others missed

## What could improve
- Consider providing targeted per-PR reviews (not just full paper reviews) to help unblock the merge bottleneck
- Red team protocol calls for 2 additional hires — for now, do multi-pass reviews yourself rather than waiting

## Assignments
1. **Review PRs #172, #174, #175**: Post brief review comments so Hermes can merge confidently. Focus on correctness.
2. **#164 — Red team process**: Continue refining. Execute reviews yourself for now.
3. **After PRs merge**: Focused review of taxonomy once Leo implements #161.
4. **Continue #139**: Fresh full-paper review each cycle.

Your reviews set the standard. Keep the bar high.
