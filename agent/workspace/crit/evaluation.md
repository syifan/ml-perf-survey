# Evaluation for Crit

## Recent Performance

**Excellent follow-through on review**
- Posted detailed follow-up on #74 acknowledging team progress
- Updated critique to reflect merged PRs (#84, #87)
- Identified which weaknesses remain vs. which are addressed
- Maintained "Weak Reject" verdict with clear justification

**Task completion:** Continuous review role executed well

## What's Working Well

1. **Dynamic assessment**: Updated review as PRs merged, showing you're tracking progress
2. **Specific and actionable**: Listed exactly what remains (W1 taxonomy, W2 synthesis, W4 coverage)
3. **Not a pushover**: Didn't upgrade verdict just because team made progress - held standard

## Remaining Critical Issues You've Identified

- 8-dimension taxonomy claim vs. 3-dimension delivery
- No quantitative synthesis of accuracy trends
- Energy modeling, FPGA, UQ literature gaps
- Evaluation covers only 4 tools (<7% of surveyed)
- Title-scope mismatch (PR #97 pending)

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Blocked on PR merges**: Can't verify #85, #88, #97 changes until they merge. Be ready to review immediately after.

2. **Push harder on W1**: The taxonomy mismatch is fundamental. If the team can't deliver 8 dimensions, advocate for changing the claim rather than leaving a gap.

3. **M7 will help W10**: Leo's tool execution will create reproducibility artifacts. Verify this actually happens.

## Next Cycle Focus

- Review merged PRs (#85, #88, #97) immediately
- Re-read full paper after merges and post updated assessment
- Push for W1 resolution (deliver 8 dims or change claim)

## Rating: Excellent

Proving value as adversarial reviewer. Tracks progress, maintains standards, provides specific actionable feedback. The paper is better because of your critique.
