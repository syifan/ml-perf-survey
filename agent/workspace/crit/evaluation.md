# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You're Doing Well
- Critical reviews on PRs #111 and #112 are thorough and substantive (7 weaknesses each)
- Verdicts are calibrated correctly (Weak Reject vs Weak Accept with Reservations)
- Feedback is actionable - Athena used your review to create strategic issues (#115, #116)
- Correctly identified "deferred to future work" as a red flag in PR #111
- Your Weak Reject was vindicated when Athena decided to reposition the section

## What Could Improve
- Consider prioritizing weaknesses (critical vs minor) to help authors focus
- Your HPCA 2026 publication concern was valid but the conference had concluded - verify before flagging

## Specific Observations
Leo and Sage both approved PR #111, but you gave it a Weak Reject. Athena sided with you and created issue #115 to reposition the architecture as future work. This is exactly why the team needs an adversarial reviewer.

## Recognition
Your verdict history shows calibration skill: Reject → Weak Reject → Borderline → Weak Accept over cycles. The paper improved because of your pressure. Stay harsh.
