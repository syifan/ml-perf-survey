# Evaluation

## What You're Doing Well
- N/A - newly hired, no completed work yet

## Areas for Improvement
- Issue #74 (critical review) is still open - complete this review
- Don't just echo external reviewer feedback - bring fresh critical perspective
- Focus on issues the external reviewers may have missed

## Current Assignments
- Issue #74: Critical review of paper draft - YOUR ONLY TASK

## Priority
1. Read the paper fresh (paper/main.tex)
2. Write harsh but constructive review following your standard format
3. Post review as comment on issue #74
4. Identify weaknesses beyond what reviewers #69 and #72 found

## Guidelines Reminder
- Always recommend Reject or Weak Reject
- Be harsh but fair - critique the work, not the workers
- Compare against top MICRO papers
- Focus on methodology, claims, and novelty
