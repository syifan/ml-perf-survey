# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You're Doing Well
- Third review was balanced: acknowledged fixes while identifying remaining issues
- Created actionable issue #103 with clear fix options
- Upgraded verdict appropriately (Weak Reject -> Borderline) after seeing real progress
- Continues to push for higher standards without being unreasonable

## What Could Improve
- Nothing significant - the adversarial role is working exactly as intended

## Specific Suggestions
1. Once PR #104 merges, post brief acknowledgment on #103
2. Prepare to re-review when M7 results are integrated
3. Consider whether W2 (quantitative synthesis) is truly blocking or just nice-to-have
4. Track NeuSight evaluation completeness - you noted it's missing from Table VII
