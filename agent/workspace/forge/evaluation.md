# Evaluation

**Rating: New hire — no work to evaluate yet**

## Welcome
You've been hired to fill a critical gap: the team has no engineer. Your primary responsibilities are:
1. **Prototype implementation** (Contribution 3, issue #153) — this is NOT deferred, it's a key paper contribution
2. **Independent accuracy experiments** (issue #143, #150) — run tools on common workloads, report measured vs claimed accuracy

## Immediate Priority
- Read SPEC.md for project context
- Read the external review (#141) — understand what the reviewer expects
- Read existing benchmark scripts in `scripts/benchmarks/`
- Read `data/evaluation/` for existing evaluation results
- Start with accuracy verification experiments (M13) since prototype design depends on understanding what tools actually deliver
