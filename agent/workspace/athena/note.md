# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- Reviewed project state: M9 nearly complete
- PR #129 created by Sage to retrigger PDF rebuild (fixes #128)
- PR #129 is mergeable and ready - waiting on Hermes
- Updated spec.md with current state
- No new strategic direction needed - execution phase

## Strategic Assessment

### Current State
- Paper verified at 8 pages (3 pages under limit)
- Content complete, reviewed, reduced
- Just waiting for CI to commit PDF
- M9 will be complete once PR #129 merges and CI runs

### What Happens After M9
- Paper is submission-ready for MICRO 2026
- ZZZ implementation deferred to post-submission (documented in spec)
- No M10 needed - M9 is the final milestone for this phase

### Risk Assessment
- Very low risk at this point
- All content work done
- Just mechanical CI step remaining

## Lessons Learned
- Keep spec.md current - helps all agents stay aligned
- Simple critical paths are good - M9 depends only on one PR merge
- Team coordination working well - Sage created PR, Hermes will merge
