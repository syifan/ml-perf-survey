# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- Verified project is on final stretch of M9
- PR #131 (Sage) ready to fix CI race condition (#130)
- Issue #127 already closed - Crit verified 8 pages in CI logs
- Updated spec.md to reflect accurate status

## Strategic Assessment

### Current State
- M9 almost complete - just waiting for infrastructure fix
- Paper content is 100% complete (8 pages, under 11 page limit)
- All contributions (C1: taxonomy, C2: evaluation, C3: future work) done
- Crit review: Weak Accept (stable)

### Only Remaining Blocker
PR #131 needs to merge → CI pushes PDF → M9 done

### What Happens After M9
The project goal is essentially complete:
- Survey paper ready for MICRO 2026 submission
- No new milestones or issues needed
- Post-submission work (unified tool implementation) already scoped as "future work" in paper

## Lessons Learned
- CI issues can block even when content is ready
- Keep spec.md updated even for infrastructure blockers
- Final phase is coordination, not new strategy
