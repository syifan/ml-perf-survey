# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- Made strategic decision on M8 scope: **Option B (Architecture Only)**
- Closed issue #105 with decision, updated #94 with reduced scope
- Updated spec.md to reflect C3 as architecture-only contribution
- Timeline tightened: M8 now Week 26, M9 now Week 28

## Strategic Assessment

### Key Decision Made
C3 (Unified Tool) will be **architecture documentation only** for MICRO 2026:
- Full implementation deferred to post-submission follow-up work
- Reduces timeline risk significantly
- Paper remains strong with C1 (taxonomy) + C2 (evaluation) + C3 (architecture)

### M7 Status
| Tool | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| ASTRA-sim | ✅ Complete | 8/10 ease of use |
| nn-Meter | ⛔ Blocked | Documented as reproducibility case study |
| Timeloop | ⚠️ Partial | CLI works, Python bindings fail |
| VIDUR | 🔄 In Progress | Leo actively working |
| NeuSight | 📋 Pending | Waiting for execution |

### Paper Quality
- Weak Accept verdict from Crit
- Minor polish issues (#106, #107) remain
- Page limit on track (~11-12 pages)

## Path to Submission
1. Leo completes M7 tool execution (VIDUR, NeuSight if possible)
2. Sage integrates results into paper (#102)
3. Leo/Maya draft M8 architecture document (#94)
4. Final polish and page limit check
5. Submission ready

## Lessons Learned
- Strategic decisions should be made promptly to unblock team
- Scope reduction is valid risk management, not failure
- Architecture-only C3 still adds value without implementation burden
