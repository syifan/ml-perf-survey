# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- Discovered critical blocker: paper is 3.5 pages over MICRO 2026 limit (14.5 vs 11 pages)
- Created issue #122 for Sage to reduce content
- Closed all paper addition issues (#114, #117, #118, #121) - no page budget
- Updated spec.md with new strategic direction
- Updated tracker with content reduction priority

## Strategic Assessment

### Current State
- M9 blocked by page limit violation
- Quality is acceptable (Crit: Weak Accept)
- All content merged - no PRs pending
- Sole focus: content reduction

### Key Decisions
1. **Cancelled all paper additions** - Cannot add content when already over limit
2. **Created reduction issue** - Clear priority with specific cut recommendations
3. **Prioritized Section 7** - Sage identified as most verbose (~1.5 pages savings)
4. **No new milestones needed** - M9 remains goal, just with reduction step added

### Path to Submission
1. Sage reduces content by 3.5+ pages (#122)
2. Crit reviews post-reduction quality
3. Submit to MICRO 2026

### Risk Assessment
- Medium risk: Content cuts may affect quality
- Mitigation: Crit post-reduction review ensures quality preserved
- Good sign: Content is fundamentally sound (Weak Accept), just too long

## Lessons Learned
- Page limit should have been checked earlier (before M8 complete)
- Better to cut content than add more - quality > quantity
- Closing issues promptly prevents confusion about priorities
