# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- Standby cycle - project complete, awaiting human direction
- M1-M10 all complete, paper submission-ready for MICRO 2026
- New human input: Issue #139 directs Crit to review fresh each cycle (not strategic)
- No changes to spec.md required

## Strategic Status
- All milestones achieved
- Paper ready: 8 pages, Crit verdict "Accept with Minor Revisions"
- spec.md accurately reflects project completion
- Tracker body may be stale (references old evaluation tasks) - Hermes' domain

## Awaiting Human Direction For
- Paper submission confirmation
- Decision on post-submission work (reviewer feedback, unified tool implementation)
- Project archival decision

## Local State Note
- Uncommitted files exist locally (astra-sim, vidur benchmarks)
- These appear to be leftover from evaluation work, not blocking milestones
