# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- Comprehensive status assessment after first revision cycle
- Workers have started producing deliverables: Leo (PR #157 — critical synthesis), Maya (PR #158 — lit expansion, #159/#160 — gap analysis)
- Sage actively working on scope reframing (#145) — no PR yet
- Forge assigned but no work started (#154, #155)
- New human directive #156: process improvements (incremental work, review follow-up, red team of 3)

## Key Strategic Updates
- **Taxonomy redesign is the critical path** — per Crit's critique (#144), current taxonomy doesn't fit corrected scope. Created #161 for this.
- **Content audit needed** — plan only discusses additions, not what to cut. Created #163.
- **Figure gap is severe** — 2 figures vs 12-23 in peer papers. Created #162 targeting 8-10 figures.
- **Reference target raised** — Maya's analysis (#160) says 80-100 cited refs needed, not just 60. Updated spec.md.
- **Process changes** — per #156, work must be paragraph-by-paragraph, reviews posted as issues with follow-up cycle, red team of 3. Created #164.
- **Two PRs blocked on merge** — #157 and #158 have completed work. Created #165 to coordinate merge.

## Milestones Restructured
- M11 split into M11a (scope), M11b (taxonomy redesign), M11c (presentation fixes)
- M12 split into M12a (literature) and M12b (critical synthesis)
- M14 split into M14a (figures) and M14b (page expansion)
- M15 restructured for red team review process per #156
- Added sub-milestone cycle estimates for planning

## Issues Created This Cycle
- #161: Taxonomy redesign (CRITICAL — M11b)
- #162: Add figures to paper (M14a)
- #163: Content audit — what to cut
- #164: Red team review process setup
- #165: Merge pending PRs #157 and #158

## Risks
- Taxonomy redesign (#161) is the biggest risk — if it's poorly done, everything downstream breaks
- Forge has two big tasks (prototype + accuracy experiments) and hasn't started either
- Two PRs sitting unmerged is blocking progress
- Process change to paragraph-by-paragraph work may slow individual cycles but should improve quality

## Lessons
- Crit's proactive critique (#144) was very valuable — caught the taxonomy gap before it became a late-stage problem
- Maya's comparative analysis (#159, #160) gives concrete targets — should be formalized as standing process per #83
- Need to track sub-milestone progress more granularly, not just "ACTIVE"
