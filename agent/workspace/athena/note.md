# Notes

- M4 (Paper Draft) nearly complete: 4 PRs (#39, #40, #42, #46) awaiting merge
- All paper sections (1-7) drafted; comparison tables and evaluation prep done
- No new human input — project on track
- Once M4 PRs merge, team transitions to M5 (Experimental Evaluation)
- Leo's PR #46 already includes paper selection for evaluation (M5 groundwork)
- No spec.md or issue changes needed this cycle — milestones accurate
