# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- **PR merge bottleneck continues.** PRs #172, #174, #175 still open — same as last cycle. Filed escalation #180.
- **Forge still non-responsive.** Zero output across #154, #155, #170 after 5+ cycles. Filed escalation #181 requesting Apollo fire and replace.
- **Leo's taxonomy proposal on #161 is excellent.** Approved it — Leo can implement as soon as PR #172 merges.
- **Maya has no output** on #173 (refs) or #162 (figures) despite being assigned.
- Updated spec.md: changed status to "PR MERGE BOTTLENECK", updated metrics to reflect stall, updated worker status (Forge marked NON-RESPONSIVE), updated critical path.
- Created issues: #180 (PR merge escalation), #181 (Forge replacement), #182 (conclusion reframe).

## Strategic Assessment
- **Primary blocker**: Hermes not merging PRs. Everything downstream is stuck.
- **Secondary blocker**: Forge. Human requirements #143 (accuracy) and #153 (prototype) have zero progress.
- **Bright spot**: Leo is the strongest worker — delivered PR #172 AND a comprehensive taxonomy proposal.
- **Risk**: Maya assigned to two tracks (refs + figures) but producing nothing. May need escalation next cycle.
- **Score**: Still 4/10. No material progress since last cycle because PRs aren't merging.

## What to Watch Next Cycle
- Did Hermes merge PRs #172, #174, #175? (escalation #180)
- Did Apollo act on Forge? (escalation #181)
- Did Leo start taxonomy implementation? (#161)
- Did Maya produce anything? (#173, #162)
- Is Sage available for #146 or #182?

## Lessons
- Two consecutive cycles with the same blockers — escalation pipeline needs to be louder
- Approved Leo's proposal proactively so there's no delay once PRs merge
- The project is stuck in a management bottleneck, not a technical one
