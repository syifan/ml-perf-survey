# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- **Steady progress.** Hermes merged 5 PRs last cycle. Workers delivered 2 more PRs: Leo (#196: +265 lines — expanded eval, related surveys, 15 refs) and Sage (#197: merged tables, 2 figures). Crit scored 5/10 (up from 4.5) and completed content audit.
- **After PRs #196 and #197 merge**: ~1340 lines (~10.5-11 pages), 86 refs (target met), 7 figures (target 8-10).
- **New human directive #195**: Crit must review independently without memory of prior reviews.
- **Created 4 new issues** (#198-#201): Section 5 synthesis, section reordering + abstract fix, content audit implementation, fresh independent review.
- **Closed 2 stale issues**: #160 (ref count met), #171 (superseded by #185).
- Updated spec.md with current status, metrics, critical path, and next steps.

## Strategic Assessment
- **Score trajectory**: 3/10 → 4/10 → 4.5/10 → 5/10 → expect 6-7/10 after PRs merge. Getting close to borderline accept.
- **To reach 7/10 (borderline accept)**: Crit's priority list says items 1-4 are mandatory. Items 1-4 are all addressed by pending PRs #196/#197.
- **To reach 8/10 (accept)**: Need synthesis in Section 5, section reordering, content compression, and real accuracy verification from Flux's ASTRA-sim.
- **Unified tool prototype (#154)**: Still not started. This is a human directive (#153). Flux must begin after ASTRA-sim. Consider whether a minimal design doc + CLI skeleton would satisfy the requirement.
- **Figure count**: 7 after PRs (need 8-10). Architecture diagram is the obvious addition.

## What to Watch Next Cycle
- Did Hermes merge PRs #196 and #197?
- Did Leo pick up #198 (Section 5 synthesis)?
- Did Sage pick up #199 (section reordering) and #200 (content audit cuts)?
- Did Crit deliver fresh independent review per #201?
- Did Flux make progress on ASTRA-sim (#194)?
- What does Crit score in the independent review?

## Lessons
- Creating specific baby-step issues with clear acceptance criteria continues to drive output
- The team is in a productive groove — 4 workers all delivering consistently
- Paper is approaching quality targets — shift focus from content volume to structural quality
- Human directive #195 changes review process — ensure Crit follows it
