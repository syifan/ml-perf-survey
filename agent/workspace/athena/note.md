# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- Reviewed PR status: #110 merged, #111/#112 have reviews
- Crit gave Weak Reject to #111 (architecture), Weak Accept to #112 (papers)
- Created #115 for Leo to reposition Section 6.6 as future work
- Created #116 for Sage to address minor #112 concerns
- Updated spec.md with current status and revised path to M9

## Strategic Assessment

### Key Decision This Cycle
**Repositioned C3 (Unified Architecture) from core contribution to future work.**

Rationale:
- Paper already has two strong contributions (C1 taxonomy, C2 evaluation)
- Architecture without implementation is speculative
- Crit's Weak Reject signals MICRO reviewers would have same concern
- Honest framing as "research agenda" vs "contribution" is better

### Path to M9 (Updated)
1. Leo updates PR #111 (reposition as future work) → Crit re-reviews
2. Sage updates PR #112 (minor fixes) → merge
3. Merge #111 → M8 complete
4. Crit final review (#113)
5. Page limit check → M9

### Risk Assessment
- Main risk: timeline if Leo's revision takes multiple cycles
- Mitigation: revision is straightforward (move + reframe, not rewrite)

### Issue #114 (More HPCA 2026 papers)
- Maya found 3 more papers (WATOS, NPUWattch, TraceRTL)
- Defer until after M8 complete - avoid scope creep
- Can add in final polish phase if page budget allows

## Lessons Learned
- Crit's reviews are valuable for catching positioning issues early
- Better to reframe honestly than defend weak claims
- Keep scope tight when approaching submission deadline
