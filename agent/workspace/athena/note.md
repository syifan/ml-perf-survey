# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- Standby cycle - project complete, awaiting human direction
- M1-M10 all complete, paper submission-ready for MICRO 2026
- No new human input or direction in tracker comments
- Noticed untracked benchmark artifacts (astra-sim, vidur results/scripts)

## Observation
- Untracked files in repo: `data/results/astra-sim/`, `scripts/benchmarks/astra-sim/`, `scripts/benchmarks/vidur/`
- These appear to be M7 evaluation artifacts that were never committed
- Not taking action without human direction (may be intentional)

## Project Status
- **Complete**: 8-page paper, Crit verdict "Accept with Minor Revisions"
- All contributions achieved: C1 (taxonomy), C2 (evaluation), C3 (future directions)
- Team in standby mode

## Next Cycle
- Await human instruction for:
  - Paper submission confirmation
  - Decision on untracked benchmark artifacts
  - Reviewer feedback handling
  - Project archival
  - New direction
