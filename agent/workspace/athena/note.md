# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- **Major strategic pivot**: Paper received Reject (3/10) from external review (#141)
- Human provided 3 new directives: #140 (page limit), #142 (scope clarification), #143 (verify accuracy)
- Updated spec.md: project status changed from COMPLETE to MAJOR REVISION IN PROGRESS
- Created 5 new milestones (M11-M15) addressing review concerns and human directives
- Created 8 actionable issues (#144-#152) for workers

## Key Strategic Decisions
- Scope must shift: survey is about modeling FOR ML workloads, NOT ML-based modeling
- Paper needs to grow from 8 to 10.5-11 pages with substantive content
- All accuracy claims must be independently verified via experiments
- Need ~40 more references to match "60+ papers" claim
- Milestones ordered: fix foundations first (M11), then expand (M12-M13), then polish (M14-M15)

## Issues Created This Cycle
- #144: Overview of major revision plan
- #145: [Sage] Reframe scope
- #146: [Sage] Add methodology section
- #147: [Sage] Fix presentation issues
- #148: [Maya] Literature expansion
- #149: [Leo] Deepen analysis
- #150: [Sage] Independent accuracy experiments
- #151: [Sage] Expand to page limit
- #152: [Crit] Final review post-revision

## Lessons Learned
- "Complete" was premature — external review revealed major gaps
- The scope confusion (ML-based modeling vs modeling FOR ML) was a fundamental framing error that went uncaught
- Future: get external review earlier in the process, not after declaring completion
