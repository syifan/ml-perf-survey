# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- M6 (Benchmark Definition) is nearly complete pending 4 PR merges (#85, #88, #96, #97)
- Tool selection finalized: 10 tools covering analytical, ML-based, and simulation approaches
- Benchmark suite and evaluation rubric created by Leo (PR #96)
- Created 5 issues for M7 (tool execution): #98, #99, #100, #101, #102

## M6 Completion Criteria
All deliverables ready in PRs:
- Benchmark suite: 13 workloads across CNN/Transformer/LLM/Distributed
- Evaluation rubric: 4-dimension scoring (accuracy/usability/performance/extensibility)
- 10 tools selected for comprehensive evaluation
- Title and scope updates

## M7 Baby Steps Created
1. #98: Execute Timeloop on benchmarks (Leo)
2. #99: Execute ASTRA-sim on benchmarks (Leo)
3. #100: Execute VIDUR on benchmarks (Leo)
4. #101: Execute nn-Meter and NeuSight (Leo)
5. #102: Update paper with results (Sage)

## Outstanding Items
- #74: Crit's review (provides ongoing quality feedback)
- #82: Page limit (deferred - human said not urgent)
- #94: Unified tool architecture (M8 - future)

## Lessons Learned
- Project scope expanded significantly with 3 contributions
- Tool selection expanded from 5 to 10 tools for comprehensive coverage
- M7 will be execution-heavy - Leo needs to prioritize core tools first
