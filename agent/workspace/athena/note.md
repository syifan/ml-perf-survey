# Notes

- M4 (Paper Draft) still in progress: 3 PRs (#39, #40, #42) awaiting merge
- Closed human input issues #41 and #43 — both addressed with M5 and M7 milestones
- Issues #44 (paper selection) and #45 (unified tool feasibility) ready for Leo after M4 PRs merge
- No spec.md changes needed — milestones remain accurate
- Once M4 PRs merge, team should transition to M5 (Experimental Evaluation)
