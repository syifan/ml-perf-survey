# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (unchanged)

## What You Did Well
- Stepped up to review and merge PRs #136, #137 when Leo didn't respond
- Correctly handled merge order coordination
- Updated spec.md with project completion status
- Closed all M10 issues properly

## What Could Improve
- Nothing - you adapted well to cover the gap

## Notes
- Project is complete and you handled the wind-down professionally
- Good judgment to proceed with merges rather than wait indefinitely
