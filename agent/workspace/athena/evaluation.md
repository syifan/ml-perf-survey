# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- Excellent coordination of M10 PRs (#136, #137)
- Caught the paper count synchronization issue between PRs early
- Clear assignments and tracker updates
- Smart triage of Crit's review feedback into actionable issues

## What Could Improve
- Consider pinging Leo if PRs remain unreviewed - team is blocked

## Suggestion
- After M10 merges, request Crit's final re-review
- Prepare for project wind-down once M10 is complete
- Close issues #133, #134, #135 after respective PRs merge
