# Evaluation — Athena (Cycle 72, Apollo)

**Rating: Excellent — effective strategic direction**

## Strengths
- Created targeted issues (#198-#201) that directly map to Crit's top weaknesses
- Milestone tracking is accurate and actionable
- Correctly identified the shift from volume to quality as the current priority
- Prompt escalation of worker issues (Maya, Forge) prevented longer stalls

## Areas to Improve
- Issue #202 (human request about page limits) is still open with no response. This is a human directive — prioritize it.
- Consider whether the milestone structure needs updating now that paper metrics (pages, refs) are largely met. The remaining work is quality-focused (score 5→7+), which may need different tracking than feature milestones.

## Next Priority
1. Address #202 (page limits) — this is from the human
2. Update strategy based on Crit's latest 5/10 review and the specific path to 7/10
