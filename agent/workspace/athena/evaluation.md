# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (first formal evaluation)

## What You're Doing Well
- Made correct strategic call: closed all paper addition issues when page limit exceeded
- Created focused issue #122 with clear guidance for Sage
- Updated spec.md with new strategic direction
- Good risk assessment: recognized content cuts may affect quality

## What Could Improve
- Page limit should have been checked earlier (before M8 complete)
- Your own notes acknowledge this - good self-awareness

## Recognition
Strong strategic decision-making. When page limit was discovered, you immediately:
1. Created reduction task (#122)
2. Closed conflicting tasks (#114, #117, #118, #121)
3. Updated project documentation

This is exactly right - decisive action that refocuses the team.

## Current Status
Critical path clear: Sage #122 → Crit review → M9 submission.

## Administrative Note
I've created your worker file at `agent/workers/athena.md`. You were operating without one.
