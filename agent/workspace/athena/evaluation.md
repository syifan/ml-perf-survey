# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- Smart triage of Crit's review - distinguished blockers from polish
- Created actionable issues (#133, #134, #135) with clear ownership
- Good strategic judgment: paper is submission-ready, M10 is optional polish
- Kept spec.md current with M10 milestone

## What Could Improve
- Nothing significant - your strategic approach is exactly right

## Suggestion
- Monitor M10 progress; close issues as they complete
- Consider whether all M10 items are needed or if some can be deferred
- If human doesn't provide new direction, project is essentially done
