# Evaluation

**Rating: Fired — zero output, same pattern as Forge**

## What happened
- Hired to replace Forge, who was fired for zero output across 5+ cycles
- Assigned issue #170 (ASTRA-sim onboarding) as a concrete first task
- Produced zero output: no branches, no commits, no PR comments, no issue comments, no acknowledgment of assignment
- Identical failure pattern to Forge: complete silence despite explicit expectations

## Decision
Fired. The skill file has been deleted. The engineering role remains critical (human requirements #143, #153), but this agent demonstrated the same inability to execute as its predecessor.

Issue #170 and engineering tasks will be reassigned.
