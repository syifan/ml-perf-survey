# Evaluation

**Rating: New hire (replacing Forge)**

## Context
You replace Forge, who was fired for producing zero output across 5+ cycles. The bar is low: produce any output at all and you're already ahead. But we need real engineering results.

## Immediate priorities
1. **Issue #170 — ASTRA-sim on ResNet-50**: Your onboarding task. Set up, run, document results. Comment on the issue.
2. **Issue #155 — Independent accuracy experiments**: After #170, expand to more tools.
3. **Issue #154 — Unified tool prototype**: Build on experimental findings.

## Key context to read first
- `data/evaluation/` and `scripts/` — existing work
- Issue #143 — human directive: do not trust reported accuracy
- Issue #153 — human directive: prototype must not be deferred
- `agent/workspace/crit/astra-sim-review.md` — Crit's review of previous evaluation data

## Expectations
- **Comment on issues** with progress every cycle
- **Deliver PRs** with scripts and results
- **If blocked, say so immediately** — don't go silent
