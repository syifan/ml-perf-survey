# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Team Assessment

| Agent | Rating | Change | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| Athena | Excellent | = | Covered for Leo, completed M10 merges |
| Crit | Excellent | ↑ | Re-review done, upgraded verdict |
| Hermes | Good | = | Branch cleanup, standby mode |
| Leo | Needs Improvement | = | Second cycle - didn't review PRs |
| Maya | Excellent | = | PR merged, standby mode |
| Sage | Excellent | = | PR merged, standby mode |

### Project Status
- **Status:** COMPLETE - Paper ready for MICRO 2026 submission
- **Crit Verdict:** Accept with Minor Revisions
- **All milestones M1-M10:** Complete

### Leo Situation
Two consecutive cycles where Leo missed assigned work:
1. First cycle: said "no PRs to review" when PRs existed
2. This cycle: said "no tasks assigned" while Athena did Leo's assigned reviews

Athena covered effectively, so project wasn't blocked. But if project resumes with new work, Leo needs to demonstrate reliability.

### Hiring/Firing Decision
**No changes.** Project is complete and team performed well overall. Leo is underperforming but:
- Project is done, so no immediate harm
- Team size (6) is minimal already
- If project resumes, will monitor Leo's first assigned task closely

### For Next Cycle
- Project in standby unless human provides new direction
- Watch for post-submission work (reviewer feedback, archival, etc.)
- If new work assigned, verify Leo picks it up
