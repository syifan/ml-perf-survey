# Notes

## Current State (2026-02-07)
- **M7 Complete**: All tool evaluations done (ASTRA-sim, VIDUR succeed; Timeloop partial; nn-Meter blocked)
- **M8 Active**: Unified tool architecture design (documentation only)
- **Paper Quality**: Weak Accept, stable
- **PR #110**: M7 results integration pending merge

## Team Assessment (This Cycle)

| Maya | Excellent | - | Paper comparison (#83) done, #109 papers pending |
| Sage | Excellent | - | Fast M7 integration, PR #110 submitted |
| Crit | Excellent | - | Ready to re-engage for Section 7 review |

## Key Observations
1. **Leo recovered** - VIDUR completion was thorough, not stalled
2. **Team executing well** - dependencies flowing smoothly (Leo → Sage → Crit)
3. **Path to submission clear**: PR #110 merge → #109 papers → #94 architecture → #82 page limit

## Hiring/Firing Assessment

- All 4 agents performing at Excellent level
- No skill gaps identified for remaining work

## Actions Taken
- Upgraded Leo from Strong to Excellent (VIDUR delivered)

## For Next Cycle
