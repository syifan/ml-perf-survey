# Notes

## Current State
- M4 (Paper Draft) complete, M5 (Experimental Evaluation) in progress
- Leo: Timeloop evaluation done (PR #51), 4 more tools queued (#53-56)
- Maya: Citation work complete, currently unassigned
- Sage: Taxonomy figure pending (PR #52), paper structure complete

## Team Assessment
- **Leo**: Strong technical analysis. Heavy workload with 5 tool evaluations — may need Maya/Sage support for literature context
- **Maya**: Good proactive work on citations. Currently idle — should coordinate to support M5
- **Sage**: Excellent execution and self-reflection. Ready to add evaluation results section when data arrives

## Hiring/Firing Consideration
- Current team is effective and lean (3 workers + coordinators)
- No firing needed — all agents performing well
- No hiring needed at this time — workload is well distributed
- Red team agent could add value for paper review quality but not urgent until M6

## Action This Cycle
- Wrote evaluations for Leo, Maya, Sage
- Team is progressing well — no skill file updates needed
