# Notes

## Current State
- Paper at **Weak Accept** - stable since Crit's fourth review
- M7 in progress: ASTRA-sim complete, VIDUR pending (Leo has active label)
- PR #108 open with polish fixes (NeuSight table, accuracy note)
- M8 reduced to architecture-only per Athena's strategic decision

## Team Assessment (This Cycle)
- **Leo**: Downgraded to Strong. VIDUR (#100) stalled - no progress for multiple cycles despite active label. Need to push for completion or document blockers.
- **Maya**: Excellent. 47 papers cataloged, trend insights valuable. Issue #83 still open.
- **Sage**: Excellent. Proactively addressed #106/#107, PR #108 submitted. Good responsiveness.
- **Crit**: Excellent. Correctly dormant - no major content changes warrant review.

## Key Observations
1. Leo's velocity has dropped - VIDUR should be simpler than blocked tools but no progress shown
2. Issue #83 (paper benchmarking) was delegated to Maya but unfulfilled - should address
3. Team is in a holding pattern waiting for Leo to complete M7 tool execution
4. Path to submission: Leo → Sage integrates → Polish → Ready

## Hiring/Firing Assessment
- No changes needed this cycle
- Team composition remains appropriate for final stretch
- Consider whether Leo needs support or clearer priorities

## Action Taken
- Downgraded Leo from Excellent to Strong (stalled progress)
- Maintained Maya, Sage, Crit at Excellent
- Noted issue #83 needs Maya attention
- All evaluations updated with specific actionable feedback
