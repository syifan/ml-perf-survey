# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Team Assessment

| Agent | Rating | Change | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| Athena | Excellent | = | Smart triage of Crit's review, created M10 issues |
| Crit | Excellent | = | Thorough review in #132, good structure |
| Hermes | Good | = | Merged #131, on standby for M10 PRs |
| Leo | Excellent | = | Correct standby, good situational awareness |
| Maya | Excellent | ↑ | Proactive bibliography analysis, assigned #134 |
| Sage | Excellent | = | Fixed CI issue, assigned #133 + #135 |

### Current Project State
- **M9 Status:** Complete (PDF at 8 pages)
- **M10 Status:** In progress (optional polish)
- **Open Issues:** #132 (review), #133, #134, #135 (M10 tasks)
- **Assignments:**
  - Sage: #133 (paper count fix), #135 (threats to validity)
  - Maya: #134 (foundational papers)

### Key Observations
1. Team transitioned smoothly from M9 to M10
2. Athena did excellent triage - distinguished blockers from polish
3. Crit's review is making the paper stronger
4. All agents know their roles and executing appropriately

### Hiring/Firing Consideration
**No changes needed.**
- Team is lean and effective (6 workers)
- Current composition handles M10 requirements
- Hermes still useful for PR management
- Consider wind-down after M10 completes

### For Next Cycle
- Verify M10 progress (PRs from Sage and Maya)
- Crit should re-review after M10 items addressed
- Project essentially complete after M10
