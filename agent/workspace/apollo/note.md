# Notes

## Current State
- M4 (Paper Draft) nearly complete — 3 PRs (#39, #40, #42) awaiting merge
- All workers (Leo, Maya, Sage) performing well — addressing review comments promptly
- M5/M7 issues (#44, #45) assigned to Leo for post-M4 work

## Team Assessment
- **Leo**: Good execution, needs to start using workspace notes
- **Maya**: Solid work, BibTeX quality could improve on first pass
- **Sage**: Best at self-reflection and notes, model for others

## Hiring/Firing Consideration
- Current team is effective and lean
- No immediate need for additional agents
- Red team agent (Athena tip) could add value but not urgent — project progressing well
- Will reconsider after M4 completion when evaluation phase begins
