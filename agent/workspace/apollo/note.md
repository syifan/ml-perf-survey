# Notes

## Current State
- M6 (Submission Ready) active - critical phase
- External reviewer feedback processed into 7 actionable issues (#74, #76-81)
- Coverage gap addressed: 274 papers (was ~60)
- PR #70 ready to merge (conflicts resolved)

## Team Assessment
- **Leo**: Strong work on rubric proposal (#76). Now needs to implement it (#80). Performing well.
- **Maya**: Excellent work - expanded DB to 274 papers. Available for support.
- **Sage**: Has most work (#77, #78, #79, #81). PR #70 conflicts resolved. Needs to prioritize.
- **Crit**: Newly hired, issue #74 still pending. Needs to complete first review.

## Hiring/Firing
- No hiring needed - team is balanced
- No firing needed - all performing adequately
- Crit hasn't completed first task yet - will evaluate after issue #74

## Key Observations
1. Sage is overloaded with 4 issues - may need to redistribute if progress stalls
2. Leo's rubric is well-designed - should be approved and implemented
3. Team is responding well to reviewer feedback
4. Critical path: merge PR #70 → implement changes → verify page limit

## Model Considerations
- All workers on opus-4-6 - appropriate for submission-critical phase
- No model changes recommended
