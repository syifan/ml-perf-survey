# Apollo — Cycle 73 Notes

## Situation
- **Three open PRs** (#203 Flux, #204 Leo, #205 Sage) — none merged since cycle 72
- **Paper metrics**: ~10.5-11 pages, 86 refs, 7 figures, score 5/10
- **Crit's fresh independent review** (#201) confirmed 5/10 with detailed actionable feedback
- **Flux** still on probation — PR #203 analyzes existing data, not new experiments
- **Human directives still open**: #143 (run experiments), #153 (unified tool prototype), #195 (independent reviews), #202 (page limits)
- **Issue #83** (recurring paper comparison) has no owner since Maya was fired

## Actions Taken
1. **Evaluations written** for all 4 workers:
   - Leo: Excellent (sustained MVP — synthesis work addresses Crit's top criticism)
   - Sage: Good (reliable editing, need more substantive additions)
   - Crit: Excellent (quality anchor — fresh reviews driving improvements)
   - Flux: Concerning (probation extended — must run actual experiment + start #154)

2. **Hired Lens** (Paragraph Reviewer):
   - Per human directive #156 (red team structure)
   - Reviews paper paragraph-by-paragraph for logic, writing, claims, spec compliance
   - Also takes over issue #83 (recurring paper comparison)
   - Model: claude-opus-4-6

3. **Updated Flux skill file**: Final probation with 3 explicit deliverables (experiment, prototype, issue comments)

4. **No firings this cycle**: Flux gets one more chance. All other workers performing well.

## Team Status (5 workers)
| Agent | Rating | Status | Key Assignment |
|-------|--------|--------|---------------|
| Leo | Excellent | Active | Section 5 restructuring, cross-review PRs |
| Sage | Good | Active | Figures, content editing, paper comparison |
| Crit | Excellent | Active | PR reviews, fresh paper reviews |
| Flux | Concerning | Final Probation | Run experiment, start #154, comment on issues |
| Lens | New | Just Hired | Paragraph reviews, paper comparison (#83) |

## Key Concerns
1. **Three open PRs blocking progress** — Crit must review, Hermes must merge
2. **#154 (unified tool prototype)** — human directive, zero progress, critical gap
3. **Score 5/10 to 7/10** — requires common-benchmark comparison (Flux), Section 5 restructuring (Leo), continued claim tightening (Sage)
4. **Crit is a bottleneck** — only quality reviewer, 3 PRs + fresh reviews + red team duties

## For Next Cycle
- Did Flux run an actual experiment? (If no: fire)
- Were PRs #203, #204, #205 merged?
- Did Lens produce first paragraph review?
- Has anyone started #154?
- What is Crit's score after pending PRs merge?
