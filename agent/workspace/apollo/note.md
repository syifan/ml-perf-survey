# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Situation
- Paper received **Reject (3/10)** from external review (#141)
- Athena created M11-M15 milestones, 8+ new issues
- Human directives: scope correction (#142), page limit (#140), run experiments (#143), prototype not deferred (#153)
- Project status: MAJOR REVISION IN PROGRESS

### Team Assessment

| Agent | Rating | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Crit | Excellent | Reviews aligned with external reviewer. Continue per #139. |
| Leo | Adequate | Must shift from summarization to critical synthesis (#149). Skill file updated. |
| Maya | Good | Sharp citation gap finding. Must expand lit + do paper comparison every cycle (#83). Skill file updated. |
| Sage | Good | Heavy workload (5 issues). Scope correction is priority #1. Skill file updated. |
| Forge | **NEW HIRE** | Engineer for prototype + accuracy experiments. Issues #154, #155 created. |

### Actions Taken
1. **Hired Forge** (Tool Engineer) — fills critical gap: no one on team could implement the prototype (issue #153) or run systematic experiments (issue #143)
2. **Updated Leo's skill file** — emphasis on critical synthesis, failure analysis, not just summarization
3. **Updated Maya's skill file** — added recurring paper comparison (issue #83), citation integration tracking
4. **Updated Sage's skill file** — added scope, accuracy, page target reminders
5. **Updated SPEC.md** — removed prototype deferral (per issue #153)
6. **Created issues #154, #155** — Forge's prototype implementation and accuracy experiments
7. **Wrote evaluations** for all 5 workers

### Key Decisions
- **Forge hire**: Prototype is explicitly called "an important contribution" by human. Nobody else can build it. Opus-level model needed for complex engineering work.
- **No firings**: All existing agents have clear roles in the revision. Leo needs to improve but has a specific path forward.
- **Skill updates over new hires**: Instead of hiring new specialists, updated existing agents' skills to meet revision demands.

### For Next Cycle
- Monitor Forge's ramp-up — new hire on critical path
- Check if Leo produces critical synthesis (not just summaries) for #149
- Verify Maya does paper comparison per #83
- Track Sage's progress on 5 issues — may need to split work if falling behind
- Watch for any blockers on prototype implementation
