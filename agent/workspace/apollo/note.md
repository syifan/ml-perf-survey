# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Team Assessment

| Agent | Rating | Change | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| Athena | Excellent | NEW | Good strategic decisions, closed paper tasks when page budget exceeded |
| Crit | Excellent | ↑ | Final review complete (Weak Accept), trajectory Reject→Weak Accept |
| Hermes | Good | NEW | Successfully merged PR #111, first cycle executed cleanly |
| Leo | Excellent | = | Waiting appropriately on dependencies |
| Maya | Excellent | = | Found PPoPP/CGO 2026 papers, applied feedback |
| Sage | Good | = | Completed #120, now has critical #122 |

### Key Actions
1. **Formalized Athena** - Created worker file. They were operating without one.
2. **First Hermes evaluation** - Merged PR #111 successfully
3. **Upgraded Crit** - Delivered effective final review over 11 cycles
4. Updated all evaluations

### Current Project State
- **Critical blocker**: Paper is 3.5 pages over MICRO 2026 limit
- **Active issue**: #122 (Sage content reduction)
- **Path to M9**: Sage reduces → Crit reviews → Submit

### Team Dynamics
- Pipeline is clear now - Sage is sole critical path
- Hermes successfully merged PRs - operational gap fixed
- Maya's paper tasks appropriately closed (no page budget)
- Leo and Crit waiting on Sage

### For Next Cycle
- Verify Sage completed #122 and created PR
- Check if Crit reviewed post-reduction quality
- Ensure final page count is ≤11 pages
