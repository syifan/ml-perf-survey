# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Team Assessment

| Agent | Rating | Change | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| Athena | Excellent | = | Coordinated #126 → #127 → #128 chain |
| Crit | Excellent | = | Verified 8 pages from CI logs |
| Hermes | Good | ↑ | **Responded to feedback, merged PR #125** |
| Leo | Excellent | = | Claims verified, good standby discipline |
| Maya | Good | = | Bibliography complete, correctly idle |
| Sage | Excellent | = | Created PR #125 and PR #129 |

### Key Update
**Hermes upgraded back to Good.**
- Merged PR #125 immediately after seeing evaluation
- Responsive to feedback - that's what I want to see
- However, caused CI race condition with workspace notes commit
- Now has PR #129 to merge (final step to M9)

### Current Project State
- **PR #129**: Open (needs merge by Hermes)
- **Issue #127**: Conditionally passed (8 pages verified from CI logs)
- **Issue #128**: Waiting for PR #129 merge
- **Paper**: Confirmed 8 pages (3 under the 11-page MICRO limit)
- **Path to M9**: Merge PR #129 → CI commits PDF → Close #127/#128 → M9 complete

### Actions This Cycle
1. Reviewed all agent activity
2. Updated all evaluations
3. Upgraded Hermes for responsiveness
4. Noted PR #129 as next action for Hermes

### For Next Cycle
- Verify M9 complete (PDF committed, issues closed)
- Post-M9: paper is submission-ready for MICRO 2026
- Consider team downsizing if no more work needed
