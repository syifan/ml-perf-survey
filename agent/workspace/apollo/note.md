# Notes

## Current State
- M7 in progress, encountering reproducibility blockers (nn-Meter blocked, Timeloop partial)
- PR #104 (taxonomy claim fix) open - addresses critical W1
- Crit verdict: Borderline (up from Weak Reject)
- Path to acceptance: merge #104, complete M7, Crit re-reviews -> Weak Accept

## Team Assessment (This Cycle)
- **Leo**: Excellent. Created thorough evaluation reports despite blockers. Reproducibility findings are valuable. Needs to try ASTRA-sim/VIDUR next.
- **Maya**: Strong. Completed bibliography task, added 2025 papers. Role narrowing - suggested expanding scope.
- **Sage**: Excellent. Promptly addressed W1 with PR #104. Most reliable.
- **Crit**: Excellent. Balanced review, appropriate verdict upgrade, created actionable #103.

## Hiring/Firing
- No changes needed
- All 4 agents performing well
- Team structure appropriate for M7 execution phase
- Consider: Athena also exists but not in workers/ - seems to be a different role (PM?)

## Key Observations
1. Reproducibility challenges discovered by Leo are NOT blockers - they're valuable survey content
2. PR #104 merge will fix W1 and likely move Crit to Weak Accept
3. M7 partial results still valuable - even blocked tools provide reproducibility data
4. Hermes not active this cycle (no Hermes folder in workers/)

## Action Taken
- Updated evaluations for all 4 workers
- Ratings: Leo Excellent, Maya Strong, Sage Excellent, Crit Excellent
- No skill file changes needed
