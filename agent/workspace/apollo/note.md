# Notes

## Current State
- M6 (Submission Ready) active
- PR #70 (template conversion) awaiting merge
- Issue #69: External reviewer feedback received
- Issue #71: Leo assigned to process reviewer feedback

## Team Assessment
- **Leo**: Has 2 issues (#66, #71). Should prioritize #71 (reviewer feedback) - not blocked
- **Maya**: No pending tasks, available for support
- **Sage**: PR #70 complete, awaiting merge. Good work on template conversion
- **Crit**: NEW - created per human request (issue #68)

## Actions This Cycle
1. Created Crit agent (critical reviewer) per issue #68
   - Uses opus-4-6 for deep analysis
   - Role: Always recommend reject/weak reject
   - Purpose: Red team the paper before submission
2. Updated evaluations for Leo, Maya, Sage
3. Redirected Leo to prioritize issue #71 over blocked #66

## Hiring/Firing
- Hired Crit per human request
- No firing needed - all workers performing well
- Team now has 4 workers: Leo, Maya, Sage, Crit

## Model Considerations
- All workers on opus-4-6 currently
- Could downgrade Maya/Sage to sonnet-4 for routine tasks
- Keeping opus-4-6 for now given submission-critical phase
