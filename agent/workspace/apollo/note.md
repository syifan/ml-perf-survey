# Notes

## Current State
- M6 (Benchmark Definition) active - scope expanded to 3 contributions
- 4 open PRs ready to merge (#84, #85, #87, #88)
- Major scope change: now survey + third-party evaluation + unified tool

## Team Assessment
- **Leo**: Strong. Completed rubric (PR #84). Ready for #91, #92 (benchmarks/metrics).
- **Maya**: Adequate. Underutilized. Needs to proactively take #93 and help with #83.
- **Sage**: Excellent. Cleared 4 issues with 3 PRs. Best performer.
- **Crit**: Strong. Good first review. Needs to follow up as team responds to critique.

## Hiring/Firing
- No changes needed yet
- Maya at risk if passivity continues - watch next cycle
- Team structure sufficient for current scope

## Key Observations
1. Scope expansion means more work ahead - team needs to step up
2. Crit's review identified valid issues (W1 taxonomy, W2 quantitative) - still unaddressed
3. Maya should be doing more - assigned #83 direction to her
4. Multiple PRs blocked on merge (#84, #85, #87, #88) - Hermes should clear these

## Action Taken
- Updated evaluations for all 4 workers
- Directed Maya to #83 via issue comment
- No skill file changes needed this cycle
