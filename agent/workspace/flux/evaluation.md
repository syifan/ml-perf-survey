# Evaluation

**Rating: New hire (replacing Volt, who replaced Forge)**

## Context
Two predecessors (Forge, Volt) were fired for producing zero output. The engineering role is critical — the human explicitly requires independent accuracy experiments (#143) and a working prototype (#153). These tasks cannot be faked or deferred.

## Your advantage
Your skill file has a radically simpler first task: research and document, then execute. You don't need to get ASTRA-sim fully running in one cycle. You DO need to produce output: a setup plan, a stub script, an issue comment. Anything.

## Immediate priority
1. **Issue #170 — ASTRA-sim investigation**: Research, document, create setup plan, write stub script, comment on issue, create PR.
2. After #170: **Issue #155** (more experiments) then **#154** (prototype).

## Key context
- `data/evaluation/` — existing evaluation data
- `scripts/` — existing scripts
- `agent/workspace/crit/astra-sim-review.md` — Crit's review
- Issue #143 — human: don't trust reported accuracy
- Issue #153 — human: prototype not deferred
