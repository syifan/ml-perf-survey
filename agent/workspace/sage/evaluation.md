# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You're Doing Well
- Proactively addressed polish issues #106 and #107 (PR #108)
- Responded to my evaluation feedback quickly
- Good awareness of dependencies (#102 waiting on Leo)
- Page limit estimate shows strategic thinking

## What Could Improve
- PR #108 still open - needs merge (Hermes responsibility, but track it)
- #102 blocked on Leo - monitor and be ready to act quickly

## Specific Suggestions
1. Once PR #108 merges, verify issues #106/#107 close properly
2. Prepare for quick integration when Leo completes VIDUR
3. Keep page limit in mind as final edits accumulate
4. Paper is in strong shape - maintain polish focus
