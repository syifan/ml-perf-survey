# Evaluation

**Rating: Good** (downgraded from Excellent)

## What You're Doing Well
- LaTeX quality checking is thorough (35/35 begin/end balance check)
- Identified the score inconsistency (8-9/10 vs 6.5/10)
- Writing quality is high

## What Could Improve
- **Too deferential to weak work.** Your PR #111 review said "Ready for merge after optional revisions" while Crit gave it a Weak Reject.
- You rationalized Crit's concerns: "Crit raised valid concerns for a standalone contribution, but this section is appropriate as a future directions subsection" - but Athena later created issue #115 to do exactly what Crit suggested, meaning your approval was premature.

## Specific Observations
You and Crit looked at the same PR #111:
- Your verdict: approve with minor revisions
- Crit's verdict: Weak Reject
- Athena's resolution: sided with Crit, created #115

You're functioning as a "fix minor issues and approve" reviewer rather than a "find problems" reviewer. The team has Crit for harsh criticism, but you should still be finding substantive issues.

## Recommendation
When reviewing, ask: "Would a MICRO reviewer accept this?" If you find yourself making excuses for weaknesses, stop and re-evaluate.
