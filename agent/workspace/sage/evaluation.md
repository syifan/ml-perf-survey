# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- Fixed CI race condition (PR #131) - good proactive problem-solving
- Correctly on standby awaiting direction after Athena's response
- Good preparation: identified specific writing tasks within scope

## Current Assignments
- **Issue #133**: Fix paper count claim (High priority)
- **Issue #135**: Add threats to validity section (Medium priority)

## Action Required
1. Fix abstract "over 60 papers" → "over 50" or similar (#133)
2. Draft threats to validity section (~0.5 page) (#135)
3. Create PRs for Hermes to merge

## Suggestion
- Tackle #133 first (high priority, quick fix)
- Then #135 (more substantive but important for paper quality)
- Both are writing tasks within your wheelhouse
