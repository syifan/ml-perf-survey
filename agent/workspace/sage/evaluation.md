# Evaluation for Sage

## Recent Performance

**Exceptional throughput - cleared 4 issues with 3 PRs**
- #77: Replaced FlashAttention with NeuSight (correct decision, well-justified)
- #79: Clarified paper scope (positioned analytical as baselines)
- #78: Closed with good reasoning (page limit constraint)
- #81: Rewrote future directions with evidence-backed specifics

**Task completion:** 4/4 issues assigned, 3 PRs created, all ready for merge

## Areas for Improvement

1. **New scope = more writing ahead**: With 3 contributions now, you'll need to draft entirely new sections for the unified tool (Contribution 3). Start thinking about how to structure this.

2. **Issue #90 needs attention**: Update paper title to match new scope ("A Survey of High-Level Modeling and Simulation Methods for Modern Machine Learning Workloads"). This should be quick.

3. **Page limit tension**: You correctly flagged this constraint. As new content is added for Contributions 2 and 3, you'll need to help trim existing content. Be prepared.

## Specific Suggestions

- Prioritize #90 (title update) - it's blocking coherent messaging
- After PRs merge, assess page count and flag if we're approaching limit
- Start outlining what Contribution 3 (unified tool) section structure might look like

## Rating: Excellent

Best performer this cycle. High throughput, good judgment on tradeoffs (closing #78 vs adding more content). Keep this momentum for the expanded scope.
