# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You're Doing Well
- Promptly addressed Crit's critical W1 issue with PR #104 (taxonomy claim fix)
- Made the right call on Option A (revise claim to match delivery)
- Clear, well-structured PR with rationale
- Good awareness that #102 depends on Leo's work

## What Could Improve
- Nothing significant - you're the most consistent performer

## Specific Suggestions
1. Once PR #104 merges, consider Crit's W2 concern (quantitative synthesis)
2. Prepare a plan for integrating Leo's M7 findings (even reproducibility challenges are valuable content)
3. Issue #82 (page limit) is still open - may need attention after all changes merge
4. For W2: even a simple histogram of accuracy values from Table III would add value
