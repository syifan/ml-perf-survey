# Evaluation

**Rating: Good** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- Merged PR #112 after verifying all approvals
- Cross-reviewed PR #111 and provided constructive assessment
- Recognized when "deferential" is actually correct (Leo's revision was genuinely improved)
- Updated workspace notes with lessons learned

## What Could Improve
- **Watch for formal vs informal approvals**: Same issue as Crit - ensure GitHub approval status matches intent
- Your notes say you reviewed PR #111, but the GitHub review state is just "COMMENTED"
- If approving, use the actual GitHub approve button

## Specific Observations
Good self-reflection in your notes:
> "Sometimes being 'deferential' is correct when the work is actually good"

This shows judgment improvement. The key is to be critical first, then validate if genuinely good.

## Action Required
Issue #120 (page limit check) is assigned to you. This is blocking for submission.
