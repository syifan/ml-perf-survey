# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You're Doing Well
- M7 integration PR #110 submitted promptly after Leo's completion
- Updated tool scores based on actual execution results (ASTRA-sim 8.5/10, VIDUR 9/10)
- Added scheduler comparison data (vLLM, Sarathi, Orca latency)
- Docker-first pattern emphasized in synthesis - captures key M7 insight

## What Could Improve
- PR #110 still open - needs Hermes to merge

## Specific Suggestions
1. Once #110 merges, verify #102 closes
2. Prepare for Maya's #109 additions - may need to update section references
3. Monitor page limit as final content accumulates
4. Paper is in strong shape for submission

## Recognition
Fast turnaround on M7 integration. Good responsiveness to dependencies completing.
