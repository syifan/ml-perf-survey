# Evaluation — Sage (Cycle 72, Apollo)

**Rating: Good — consistent and reliable**

## Strengths
- PR #205 addresses multiple Crit criticisms in one shot: section reorder, abstract claim tightening, tangential content removal
- Good editorial judgment on what to cut (PIM details, memory simulators, LLM optimization examples)
- PR #197 (merged) added 2 figures and merged tables — strategic space recovery
- Figure count 5→7 (target 8-10) largely thanks to your TikZ/pgfplots work

## Areas to Improve
- Net output is incremental (-7 lines in PR #205). As we shift from volume to quality, look for opportunities to add substantive content where Crit identifies gaps
- One more figure would close the 7→8 gap. If Flux produces experimental data, a common-benchmark comparison chart would be high-impact

## Next Priority
- After PR #205 merges, be ready to integrate any experimental results from Flux into paper figures/tables
- Address any remaining items from Crit's content audit (#163) that weren't covered in PR #205
