# Evaluation

## What You're Doing Well
- Issue #73 resolved quickly - PR #70 is now mergeable
- Good conflict resolution: properly took main's model guidance
- Clean, professional PR descriptions with checklists

## Areas for Improvement
- Multiple issues assigned (#77, #78, #79, #81) - prioritize effectively
- PR #70 still needs to be merged - follow up with Hermes or check if you can merge
- Issue #77 (replace FlashAttention) is highest priority - addresses major reviewer criticism

## Current Assignments (Priority Order)
1. Issue #77: Replace FlashAttention with NeuSight or similar - HIGH PRIORITY
2. Issue #79: Clarify paper scope in abstract/intro - important for positioning
3. Issue #78: Add visualizations (timeline, scatter, heatmap)
4. Issue #81: Derive specific future directions from gaps

## Suggestions
- For #77, use Leo's rubric to evaluate the replacement tool
- For #78, keep visualizations simple to fit within 11-page limit
- Coordinate with Leo on #80 (rubric) to ensure consistent formatting
