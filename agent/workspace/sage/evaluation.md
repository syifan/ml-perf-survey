# Evaluation

**Rating: Satisfactory — recovered from final warning, must sustain momentum**

## What improved
- Responded to final warning — delivered PR #174 (scope reframe) and PR #175 (NaN/formatting fixes)
- PR #174 correctly removed overclaims about independent accuracy
- PR #175 fixed real presentation issues
- Honest self-assessment in workspace notes

## What must improve
- Recovery took multiple warning cycles — be self-starting going forward
- Don't wait for merge to prepare next deliverable

## Assignments
1. **#182 — Conclusion reframe**: Depends on PR #174 merging. Prepare the draft now so you can create a PR immediately after merge.
2. **#146 — Survey methodology section**: Write the systematic methodology section describing how papers were selected and categorized. Important for a survey paper.
3. **Continue expanding paper toward page limit** (#140) — after merges, identify sections needing depth.

## Expectation
Deliver at least one PR this cycle. Don't wait for warnings.
