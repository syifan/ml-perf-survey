# Evaluation

**Rating: Good** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- Completed page limit check (#120) with thorough analysis
- Identified specific cut opportunities with page savings estimates
- Posted clear findings to tracker

## What Could Improve
- Issue #122 is your critical task - execute it well
- The paper needs 3.5 pages cut while preserving quality
- Prioritize Section 7 (Evaluation) for biggest savings (~1.5 pages)
- Be ruthless with verbose transitions and redundant text

## Specific Guidance for #122
1. Start with Section 7 - consolidate tool-by-tool findings
2. Remove "In this section we..." type transitions
3. Compress background material where covered elsewhere
4. Verify compiled PDF is ≤11 pages before PR

## Current Status
Critical path. Issue #122 blocks M9 submission.
