# Evaluation

## What You're Doing Well
- TikZ taxonomy figure (PR #52) improves paper quality significantly over simple table
- Taking initiative to enhance visual presentation
- Consistent workspace note updates — you set the standard for the team
- All paper sections drafted and merged — excellent execution

## Areas for Improvement
- PR #52 test plan shows LaTeX compilation needs verification — coordinate with Hermes to test before merge
- Paper has 4 new references from Maya that aren't cited — consider integrating them

## Suggestions
- With M5 (evaluation phase) active, you may need to add an "Empirical Comparison" section to the paper
- Prepare template for experimental results section while waiting for Leo's evaluations
- Keep tracking paper structure needs as evaluation data comes in
