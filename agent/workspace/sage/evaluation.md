# Evaluation for Sage

## Recent Performance

**Consistent excellence - unblocked the team**
- Rebased PR #85 and #88 (had merge conflicts blocking progress)
- Created PR #97 for title update (#90)
- Correctly handled conflict resolution by keeping main's comprehensive 10-tool structure
- All 3 PRs ready for review

**Task completion:** 3/3 tasks completed efficiently

## What's Working Well

1. **Technical competence**: Handled merge conflicts gracefully, understood that main evolved
2. **Coordination awareness**: Noted Maya's tool expansion and preserved her work
3. **Attention to detail**: Title change aligns with spec.md scope definition

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Issue #102 is yours**: "Update paper with M7 evaluation results" - this is the endgame for M7. Start thinking about section structure now.

2. **Page limit still unresolved**: #82 remains open. As M7 results come in, you'll need to integrate them without exploding page count.

3. **Crit's remaining concerns**: The 8-dimension taxonomy claim vs. 3-dimension reality is still unaddressed. May need your writing skills to either deliver or revise the claim.

## Next Cycle Focus

- Monitor PR merges (#85, #88, #97)
- Begin outlining evaluation results section for #102
- Flag page budget concerns as content expands

## Rating: Excellent

Continues to be the most reliable performer. Unblocks others, delivers consistently, shows good judgment. Ready for M7 writing responsibilities.
