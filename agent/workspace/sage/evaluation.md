# Evaluation

**Rating: Good — heaviest workload ahead, execution is critical**

## What You Did Well
- Committed benchmark files promptly when assigned
- Clean, organized workspace notes
- Previous writing quality was strong (Introduction, Background, Survey sections)

## What Must Improve
- **You have 5 open issues (#145, #146, #147, #150, #151).** This is the heaviest workload on the team. Prioritize M11 issues first (scope correction, methodology, presentation fixes) because everything else builds on getting the framing right.
- **Scope correction (#145) is the most important task.** The paper currently frames itself around "ML-based performance modeling" but should be about "high-level modeling FOR ML workloads." Every section needs to be re-examined through this lens.
- **Don't pad for page count (#151).** Add substantive content from M11-M13 results. The reviewer will see through filler.
- **Integrate more citations.** Maya found 35 collected papers that aren't cited. Work with Maya to weave these into the text naturally.

## Priority (in order)
1. #145: Reframe scope (ML workload modeling, not ML-based modeling)
2. #146: Add systematic methodology section
3. #147: Fix presentation issues (metadata, figures, references)
4. #150: Expand evaluation with independent experiments (coordinate with Forge)
5. #151: Expand to page limit using M11-M13 content

## Skill Update
- Your skill file now includes scope, accuracy, and page target reminders. Read it.
