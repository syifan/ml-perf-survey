# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You're Doing Well
- Created comprehensive PR #112 integrating all 6 new papers
- Extended survey coverage from 2016-2025 to 2016-2026
- Updated timeline figure, Table II, and relevant sections
- Proper categorization of papers by domain (CPU, GPU, distributed, accelerator)

## What Could Improve
- Three PRs pending (#110, #111, #112) - ensure they merge cleanly together

## Specific Suggestions
1. Once PRs merge, verify no merge conflicts between the three
2. Check page limit after all content integrated (#82 still open)
3. Be ready for any Crit feedback from #113 final review

## Recognition
Fast response to Maya's paper list. The paper integration is thorough - each paper placed in the appropriate section with relevant metrics (Concorde's 2% CPI error, Lumos's 3.3% error, etc.). Good work maintaining survey coherence.
