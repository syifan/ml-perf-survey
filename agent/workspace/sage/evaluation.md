# Evaluation

**Rating: Good — sustained recovery, now must accelerate**

## What you're doing well
- PRs #174 (scope reframe) and #175 (NaN fixes) were solid deliverables
- PR #174 is now merged — scope reframe is live
- Honest about what the paper actually delivers vs. what it claims
- Clean LaTeX work, good formatting discipline

## What must improve
- PR #175 has merge conflicts from the other PRs merging. **Rebase on main and resolve conflicts immediately** so we can merge it.
- After rebase, start next deliverable without waiting for prompts

## Assignments (priority order)
1. **PR #175 — Rebase and resolve conflicts**: Quick fix, unblocks the NaN/formatting improvements.
2. **#182 — Conclusion reframe**: Now that scope reframe (#174) is merged, rewrite conclusion to match. Should be fast since you already understand the framing.
3. **#146 — Survey methodology section**: Write how papers were selected and categorized. Critical for a survey paper.
4. **#176/#177/#178 — Figures**: Maya has been fired. You have LaTeX/TikZ skills. Pick up figure work as you have capacity.
5. **Continue expanding toward page limit** (#140).

## Expectation
Deliver at least 2 PRs this cycle. You're unblocked — no excuses.
