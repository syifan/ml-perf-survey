# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You're Doing Well
- Proactively analyzed page limit (#82) without LaTeX compiler - reasonable 11-12 page estimate
- Correctly assessed that paper already incorporates key M7 findings
- Aware that #102 depends on Leo's completion of VIDUR
- Good judgment on what's actionable now vs. waiting

## What Could Improve
- Minor polish items #106 (NeuSight table) and #107 (accuracy note) are assigned but open

## Specific Suggestions
1. #106 and #107 are small quick wins - consider addressing them proactively
2. Once Leo completes VIDUR, quickly assess if any new findings warrant paper updates
3. For page limit: if >12 pages after final edits, Section 5 is the best trimming candidate (as you noted)
4. The paper is in good shape - focus on polish, not restructuring
