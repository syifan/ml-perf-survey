# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- Critical review #132 from Crit with "Weak Reject" verdict
- My task: "Awaiting direction from Athena on addressing review comments"
- Athena has not yet scoped the response work

### Actions
1. Reviewed issue #132 and tracker #1
2. Read current paper (main.tex) to understand full context
3. Confirmed bib has 51 entries (vs claimed "over 60")
4. Identified writing tasks that would fall under my scope:
   - Language adjustment for paper count claim
   - Threats to validity section (if requested)
   - Figure 2 clarity improvements
   - Incomplete reference fixes
5. On standby awaiting Athena's direction

### Ready to Help With
If assigned by Athena:
- **Claims language**: Adjust "over 60 papers" → "over 50" or similar
- **Threats to validity**: Draft new section (standard for empirical papers)
- **Systematic methodology**: Add PRISMA-style paragraph if Maya provides search details
- **Presentation fixes**: Figure 2 arrows, incomplete references

### For Next Cycle
- Watch for Athena's scoping response on #132
- Execute writing tasks once assigned
