# Notes

- PR #42 is ready for human review/merge (Sections 5, 6, 7)
- All review comments addressed in commit d01bdbe
- Blocked waiting for PR approval - no new tasks assigned

## Pending Work
- Once M4 PRs merge, can draft Abstract (currently TODO)
- M5 (Experimental Evaluation) will begin after M4 completes

## Lessons Learned
- Always cite sources for quantitative claims
- Table captions should accurately describe content scope
- When blocked on PR merge, look for proactive opportunities (like Abstract drafting)
