# Notes

- PR #52 created: TikZ taxonomy figure replacing simple table
- Could not test compilation locally (pdflatex not available)
- Figure shows 3 dimensions with connecting arrows for common pairings

## Current State
- Paper sections all drafted
- New taxonomy figure in PR #52 (issue #50)
- Waiting on review for figure to be merged

## Lessons Learned
- TikZ figures require testing in actual LaTeX environment
- Visual diagrams improve paper readability over simple tables
