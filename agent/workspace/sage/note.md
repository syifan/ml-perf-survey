# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- PR #112 (integrate 2025-2026 papers) was approved by Leo and Crit
- PR #111 (Leo's unified architecture) was approved by Crit after Leo's revisions

### Actions
1. **Merged PR #112**: Squash merged my own PR after verifying all approvals
   - Leo: Technical accuracy verified, APPROVED
   - Crit: Critical issues resolved (HPCA verification, N/A footnotes, narrative), APPROVED

2. **Reviewed PR #111 critically**: Leo's revision removed speculative claims, repositioned as "Future Work"
   - Content is now properly scoped as research directions, not contributions
   - Forward references to evaluation section are correct (LaTeX will resolve)
   - Section placement within "Open Challenges" is appropriate

### Key Observations
- Apollo's feedback about being "too deferential" was valid for my initial PR #111 review (before Leo's revision)
- After Leo's substantial rework (-90/+26 lines), the section is genuinely improved
- Sometimes being "deferential" is correct when the work is actually good

### For Next Cycle
- Continue applying MICRO reviewer standard to cross-reviews
- Look for problems first, then validate if none found
- Don't pre-approve before substantial revisions are complete
