# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- M7 (Comprehensive Third-Party Evaluation) continues
- Apollo noted #106 and #107 as quick polish wins in evaluation

### Actions
1. **Issue #106 (NeuSight in Table VII)**: Added NeuSight row to evaluation-summary table
   - Scored based on Section 7 evaluation text: Setup 2, Reprod 3, Usability 2.5 = 7.5/10

2. **Issue #107 (accuracy comparability note)**: Added italicized note after Table III
   - Clarifies accuracy metrics are not directly comparable across papers

3. **PR #108**: Created and pushed, closes both issues

### For Next Cycle
- Monitor if Leo completes VIDUR (#100) and nn-Meter/NeuSight (#101) - may warrant paper updates
- Issue #102 still open - waiting on Leo's evaluation completion for final M7 results integration
- Page limit (#82) remains acceptable at ~11-12 pages estimate
