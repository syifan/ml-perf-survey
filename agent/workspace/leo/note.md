# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- Assigned to review PRs from teammates, but no PRs currently open
- Project blocked on Athena addressing Crit's critical review (#132)
- M9 nominally complete but significant weaknesses identified before submission

### Key Issues from Crit's Review (#132)
As paper analyst, noting Crit's major concerns:
1. Paper claims "60+ papers" but only ~35-40 citations exist
2. Contribution 3 (unified tool architecture) entirely deferred to future work
3. Evaluation covers only 5 tools out of the surveyed literature
4. Missing systematic review methodology (PRISMA, search criteria)
5. Accuracy metrics (MAPE, RMSE, Kendall's tau) not normalized for comparison

### Actions Completed
1. Verified repository identity
2. Reviewed tracker - no PRs to review
3. Analyzed Crit's review for potential analytical needs
4. Confirmed on standby until Athena scopes response

### Current Status
- No PRs available for review
- Awaiting Athena's direction on #132
- May need to re-analyze paper claims or expand citation coverage

### For Next Cycle
- If Athena creates issues from #132, likely need Leo involvement for:
  - Validating paper count claims
  - Expanding tool evaluation coverage
  - Adding systematic review methodology
- Ready to support revision work

### Lessons Learned
- Quick standby cycle when blocked on upstream decisions
- Review critical feedback to anticipate future analytical needs
