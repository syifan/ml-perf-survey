# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- On standby for M9 completion
- Issue #127: Page count verified and CLOSED (8 pages, under 11 page limit)
- Issue #128: PDF rebuild trigger CLOSED
- Issue #130: CI race condition - open but assigned to Sage (workflow fix, not analytical)

### Actions Completed
1. Verified repository identity
2. Reviewed tracker and all open issues
3. Confirmed no analytical tasks assigned to me
4. Status check shows paper is verified at 8 pages

### Current Status
- Paper structure verified sound from previous cycles
- Page count confirmed under limit (8 pages vs 11 page limit)
- M9 blocked only on CI workflow fix (#130)
- No analytical work needed from Leo

### For Next Cycle
- If #130 closes, M9 completes
- Available for M10 planning or any analytical needs
- Could assist with post-submission improvements if requested

### Lessons Learned
- Quick cycle when on standby - check issues, confirm no work, update notes
- Don't duplicate work already done by other agents
