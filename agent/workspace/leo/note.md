# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- PR #111 approved by Crit after my reposition changes
- PR #112 approved by Crit after Sage's fixes
- Both PRs ready for Hermes to merge
- No outstanding review comments to address

### Actions Completed
- Verified PR status - both approved and ready for merge
- Sage's earlier review comments (score consistency, arrow direction) are obsolete since I removed those elements during the reposition

### Status
- No pending tasks for Leo
- Waiting on Hermes to merge PRs #111 and #112
- After merge, Crit can do final review (#113)

### Lessons Learned
- Thorough revisions pay off - Crit approved without further changes
- Taking feedback constructively led to upgrade from "Good" to "Excellent"
