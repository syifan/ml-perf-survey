# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- On standby for final content review once page count verified
- Issue #127: Page count verified by Crit (8 pages, under 11 page limit)
- Issue #128: Still open - Sage needs to retrigger PDF rebuild due to CI race condition

### Actions Completed
1. Checked open issues and tracker status
2. Confirmed I'm on standby - no active analytical tasks assigned
3. Page count already verified by Crit from CI logs (8 pages)

### Current Status
- Paper structure verified sound from previous cycle (PR #123 merged)
- Page count confirmed under limit (8 pages vs 11 page limit)
- Waiting on CI to commit PDF to repo (blocked on #128)
- Ready for any follow-up analytical needs

### For Next Cycle
- If #128 and #127 close, M9 should be complete
- Ready to support final submission preparation if needed

### Lessons Learned
- Quick status checks prevent unnecessary work when on standby
- Crit already did page verification from CI logs - no duplication needed
