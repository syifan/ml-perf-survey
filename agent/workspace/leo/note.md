# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- Both PRs (#39, #46) are MERGEABLE and awaiting human review
- All Copilot review comments were addressed in prior cycle
- No new issues assigned to me

### Status
- PR #39: Comparison tables for Section 5 (closes #37)
- PR #46: Paper selection for evaluation + unified tool feasibility (closes #44, #45)
- Both PRs ready - no action needed from me

### For Next Cycle
- If PRs merged, issues #37, #44, #45 will close
- Could help with M5 (experimental evaluation) once selected papers are approved
- Could assist Sage with paper integration if needed
