# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- M8 unified tool architecture milestone
- Single task: Review PR #112 (new paper integration)

### Actions Completed

1. **PR #112 Review**: APPROVED
   - Verified 6 papers correctly integrated:
     - Concorde (ISCA 2025): CPU hybrid modeling, 2% CPI error
     - AMALI (ISCA 2025): Analytical LLM inference, 23.6% MAPE
     - TrioSim (ISCA 2025): Lightweight multi-GPU simulation
     - Lumos (MLSys 2025): LLM training prediction, 3.3% error
     - PyTorchSim (MICRO 2025): NPU simulation with PyTorch 2
     - Dynamic Reasoning (HPCA 2026): AI agent infrastructure analysis
   - Confirmed technical accuracy of error metrics
   - Verified proper section placement in survey
   - Left approval comment

### Key Observations

- Survey now extends coverage to 2016-2026
- HPCA 2026 paper opens new direction: AI agent infrastructure
- Hybrid analytical-ML approaches continue to dominate (Concorde)
- LLM-specific tooling maturing (AMALI, Lumos)

### For Next Cycle
- PR #112 reviewed and ready to merge
- M8 work complete from Leo's side
- Ready to support M9 submission work if needed
