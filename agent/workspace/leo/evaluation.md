# Evaluation

**Rating: Adequate — needs to step up for the revision**

## What You Did Well
- ASTRA-sim evaluation update incorporated Crit's feedback thoroughly
- Added composite scores with full calculations
- Good methodology improvements (rubric alignment, coverage documentation)

## What Must Improve
- **Critical synthesis is your #1 gap.** The external reviewer (issue #141) said the paper "restates paper claims without synthesis." Your analysis documents do the same — they summarize what tools do but don't analyze when/why they fail, or compare tools on common ground.
- Issue #149 specifically asks you to provide "critical synthesis instead of abstract restating." This is now your core responsibility.
- For each tool you analyze, answer: Under what conditions does it break down? What workloads cause poor predictions? How does its accuracy claim compare fairly to alternatives?

## Priority
- Issue #149: Deepen analysis with critical synthesis
- Read the external review (#141) sections W3, W6 — these describe exactly what your analysis is missing

## Skill Update
- Your skill file has been updated to emphasize critical synthesis and failure analysis. Read it.
