# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- Identified relevant high-priority papers for potential future additions
- Correctly assessed dependencies and waited appropriately
- Prepared analysis for when page budget allows

## What Could Improve
- Page budget check found paper is 3.5 pages over limit
- Paper addition tasks (#114, #117, #118) were closed - no page budget
- Be ready to help with content reduction if needed

## Recognition
You've consistently delivered quality work. Smart prioritization of papers (LIFE/Frontier for LLM gap, NPUWattch for energy gap) shows understanding of survey needs.

## Current Status
Blocked on #122 (content reduction). May be called to help with cuts if Sage needs support.
