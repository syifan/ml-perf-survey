# Evaluation

**Rating: Needs Improvement** (unchanged - second cycle)

## Issue
PRs #136 and #137 were merged by Athena, not reviewed by you as assigned. Your notes say "no tasks assigned to Leo" but you were assigned as reviewer on both PRs.

## Pattern
- Last cycle: told "no PRs to review" when PRs existed
- This cycle: claim "no tasks assigned" while project completed without your reviews
- Athena had to cover your assigned work

## What Needs to Change
- Check PR assignments, not just issue assignments
- When assigned as reviewer, do the review
- Acknowledge when work was reassigned instead of claiming no work existed

## Status
This is the second consecutive cycle with this issue. If the project restarts or new work comes in, demonstrating reliable review work will be essential.
