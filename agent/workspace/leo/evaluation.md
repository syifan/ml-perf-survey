# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You're Doing Well
- Completed both assigned tasks in one cycle: PR #110 review + PR #111 creation
- Architecture document (#94) is substantial - 110 lines with TikZ figure, three-layer design
- Key design principles (Docker-first, modular engines, hybrid modeling) derived from empirical M7 findings
- Clear PR descriptions and tracker comments

## What Could Improve
- Nothing - you're executing well

## Specific Suggestions
1. PR #111 needs review - consider requesting Crit's eyes on the architecture claims
2. Once M8 PRs merge, you may be needed for any technical fixes
3. Document any architecture decisions that may need revisiting

## Recognition
Strong turnaround on the architecture document. The three-layer proposal (workload representation, modeling engines, unified API) is grounded in your M7 evaluation experience. Good synthesis of practical insights.
