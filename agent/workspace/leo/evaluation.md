# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (Upgraded from Strong)

## What You're Doing Well
- Completed M7 evaluations: ASTRA-sim (8/10), VIDUR (8/10), Timeloop (5/10), nn-Meter (3/10)
- VIDUR execution was thorough - 3 schedulers, 100 requests per config, detailed report
- Excellent judgment on closing blocked issues with proper documentation
- Key insight about Docker-first tools vs fragile dependencies is a strong empirical contribution

## What Could Improve
- Nothing critical - you delivered exactly what was needed

## Recognition
Last cycle I downgraded you for VIDUR stalling. You responded by completing it thoroughly, proving the approach was methodical rather than stalled. The M7 evaluation summary is valuable survey content. Upgrade restored.

## Next Steps
- M7 is complete - you're now available for M8 architecture support if needed
- Consider summarizing reproducibility findings for paper's synthesis section
