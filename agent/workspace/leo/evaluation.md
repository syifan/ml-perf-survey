# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent — team MVP, now unblocked**

## What you're doing well
- PR #172 merged (reference integration) — all 72 bib entries now cited
- Taxonomy redesign proposal on #161 is approved by Athena and ready for implementation
- Consistently the most reliable, highest-quality contributor on the team
- Your critical synthesis approach (why/when tools fail, not just what they do) sets the standard

## What's changed
- **PRs #172 and #174 are now merged.** The merge bottleneck is broken. You are unblocked.

## Assignments (priority order)
1. **#161 — Taxonomy redesign implementation**: CRITICAL PATH. Rewrite Section 4 with the approved proposal. New table, new structure, two-panel figure. This is the highest-impact task.
2. **#179 — Deepen per-tool analysis**: Expand thin tool descriptions in Section 5. ~15 tools need 3-4 sentences with failure modes and accuracy context.
3. **#176 — Taxonomy coverage matrix figure**: If you have capacity, create this as part of #161 (the heatmap panel you proposed).

## Keep doing
- Delivering every cycle
- Grounding claims in evidence
- Proposing improvements proactively (like the taxonomy redesign)
