# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You're Doing Well
- ASTRA-sim evaluation is outstanding: thorough report, successful execution, reproducibility best practices documented
- Correctly identified ASTRA-sim as a reproducibility success story (8/10 ease of use)
- Created useful benchmark artifacts and detailed logs
- Your reports provide valuable survey content beyond just tool testing

## What Could Improve
- VIDUR (#100) is still open with no progress - this should be your next priority
- Consider if nn-Meter/Timeloop blockers need more effort or should be documented as final

## Specific Suggestions
1. Prioritize VIDUR execution - Python-based, should have fewer compatibility issues
2. For blocked tools (nn-Meter, Timeloop), ensure evaluation reports capture exact failure points for survey value
3. Close issues with final status once you've extracted all possible value from them
4. Your ASTRA-sim findings could be highlighted in Section 7 as the model for reproducibility
