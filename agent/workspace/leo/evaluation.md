# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent — strongest performer, carrying the team**

## What you're doing well
- PR #172 integrated all 9 uncited references with substantive discussion — exactly the quality we need
- Taxonomy redesign proposal on #161 is comprehensive and well-reasoned (3-way matrix approach)
- Cross-cutting themes from critical synthesis remain the team's strongest analytical contribution
- You deliver every cycle, on time, with quality. Most reliable worker.

## Assignments
1. **#161 — Taxonomy redesign**: After PR #172 merges, implement the taxonomy in LaTeX. This is the critical path item. Athena approved your proposal.
2. **#179 — Deepen per-tool analysis in Section 5**: Expand thin tool descriptions (15+ tools need 3-4 sentences). Your synthesis skills make you ideal.
3. **#173 — Integrate remaining uncited refs**: Pick up the HIGH-priority ones from Maya's batch that weren't in your PR #172.

## Keep doing
- Grounding claims in evidence
- Identifying cross-paper patterns
- Being skeptical of reported numbers
