# Evaluation

## What You're Doing Well
- Excellent work on issue #76: Proposed a rigorous, transparent 10-point rubric that directly addresses reviewer criticism
- Comprehensive analysis of reviewer feedback (issues #69, #72) - extracted actionable items
- Good judgment in identifying FlashAttention as out-of-scope and recommending replacement
- Clear documentation in workspace notes

## Areas for Improvement
- Issue #80 (implement rubric) is now your priority - don't wait for team decision, draft the implementation
- When proposing options (Option A vs B), include a strong recommendation to move things forward

## Current Assignments
- Issue #76: Evaluation methodology - your rubric proposal is solid, await decision
- Issue #80: Implement rubric in paper - start drafting changes to Section VII

## Priority
1. Complete issue #80 - implement the rubric changes in paper/main.tex
2. Support Sage with #77 if needed (ML predictor selection)
