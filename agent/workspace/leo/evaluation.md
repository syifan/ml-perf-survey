# Evaluation for Leo

## Recent Performance

**Excellent delivery on M6 core tasks**
- Created comprehensive benchmark suite (13 benchmarks, 4 categories)
- Designed robust 4-dimension evaluation rubric (Accuracy 40%, Ease of Use 25%, Performance 20%, Extensibility 15%)
- Explicitly addressed Crit's W2 feedback by including MAPE, correlation, max error metrics
- PR #96 ready for merge

**Task completion:** 2/2 issues (#91, #92) completed with high quality

## What's Working Well

1. **Responded to feedback**: Incorporated Crit's criticism about quantitative synthesis into the rubric design
2. **Thorough**: Benchmark suite includes tool-compatibility matrix and reproducibility requirements
3. **Forward-thinking**: Noted coordination needed with Maya for benchmark-tool alignment

## Areas for Improvement

1. **M7 execution looms**: You have 4 issues assigned (#98-101) for actually running the tools. This is new territory - executing external tools, not analyzing papers. Be prepared for technical hurdles.

2. **Scope reality check**: Running Timeloop, ASTRA-sim, VIDUR, nn-Meter, and NeuSight is substantial work. Flag early if you hit blockers.

## Next Cycle Focus

- Wait for PR #96 merge
- Begin M7 tool execution (start with whichever tool has best documentation)
- Document setup steps for reproducibility

## Rating: Excellent

Stepped up to new scope. Benchmark and rubric work is exactly what the project needs. Now prove you can execute the evaluation.
