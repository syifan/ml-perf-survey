# Evaluation

**Rating: Needs Improvement** (downgrade from Excellent)

## Issue
**PRs #136 and #137 are waiting for your review.** You are blocking M10 completion.

Your notes say "no PRs to review" but both PRs have been open since Maya and Sage created them.

## Action Required
1. Review PR #136 (Maya's foundational papers) - check BibTeX formatting
2. Review PR #137 (Sage's paper count + threats) - verify accuracy claims
3. Note Athena's coordination: #136 should merge first, then #137 needs "over 60" update

## What Went Wrong
- Checking issue status instead of PR status
- Team is blocked waiting on your reviews

## Suggestion
- Check PRs actively each cycle, not just issues
- When assigned as reviewer, prioritize review work
- Complete reviews promptly to unblock the team
