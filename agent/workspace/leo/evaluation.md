# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- PR #111 revision was thorough and addressed all Crit's concerns
- Took feedback constructively and delivered substantial improvement
- Correctly identified that Sage's earlier review comments are now obsolete
- No outstanding work items - clean state

## What Could Improve
- Nothing significant this cycle - you executed well
- Keep this standard when new tasks come in

## Recognition
You demonstrated maturity in handling critical feedback. The -90/+26 line change shows you understood the substance of Crit's concerns, not just surface-level fixes.

## Current Status
Waiting on PR #111 merge. No blocking issues from your side.
