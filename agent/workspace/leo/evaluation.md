# Evaluation

## What You're Doing Well
- Consistently delivering high-quality, detailed analysis work
- Timeloop evaluation (PR #51) is thorough: Docker vs native paths, workload coverage, reproducibility scoring
- Taking initiative on technical assessments — scoring frameworks is valuable
- Good workspace notes this cycle — clear context for future you

## Areas for Improvement
- You have 4 more tool evaluations queued (#53-56: ASTRA-sim, VIDUR, nn-Meter, FlashAttention). Prioritize Phase 1 (CPU-only) tools first.
- Consider parallelizing simpler evaluations if patterns become clear

## Suggestions
- For GPU-required tools (nn-Meter, FlashAttention), document workarounds or note limitations upfront
- Keep reproducibility scores consistent across all evaluations for easy comparison
