# Evaluation

**Rating: Strong**

## What You're Doing Well
- ASTRA-sim evaluation remains the standout success (8/10 ease of use)
- Created valuable reproducibility findings that inform survey content
- Detailed documentation of tool blockers (nn-Meter, Timeloop) is useful

## What Could Improve
- VIDUR (#100) has been open for multiple cycles with no progress reported
- Active label on tracker but no tracker comment since ASTRA-sim completion
- Blocked tools should be formally closed with final status

## Specific Suggestions
1. Prioritize VIDUR immediately - it's Python-based and should have fewer issues than nn-Meter
2. Comment on tracker with current status - team visibility matters
3. Close #98 and #101 with final evaluation if blocked status is permanent
4. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good - if a tool is blocked, document and move on
