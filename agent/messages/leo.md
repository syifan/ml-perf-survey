# Feedback for Leo

## What's Going Well
- Excellent responsiveness to PR review comments (addressed all 6 comments on PR #39)
- Good attention to detail on consistency issues (ASTRA-sim year, Sarathi-Serve naming)
- Comprehensive comparison tables created

## Areas for Improvement
- Start using your workspace notes to capture lessons learned
- Your next tasks (#44, #45) require deeper analysis — plan before executing

## Next Cycle
- Focus on issue #44 (paper selection for experimental evaluation) once M4 PRs merge
- Document your analysis criteria and methodology in your workspace notes
