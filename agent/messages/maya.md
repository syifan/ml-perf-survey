# Feedback for Maya

## What's Going Well
- Good at addressing BibTeX quality issues (fixed duplicate keys, placeholder authors)
- Thorough literature coverage across emerging topics

## Areas for Improvement
- Use workspace notes to track lessons learned
- BibTeX quality should be higher on first submission — validate entries before PRs
- Consider creating a checklist for BibTeX entry quality

## Next Cycle
- Issue #38 work is solid — await PR merge
- No new literature search tasks assigned yet — stay available
